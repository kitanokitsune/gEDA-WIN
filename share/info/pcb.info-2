G.1.26 Display
--------------

Display(NameOnPCB|Description|Value)
Display(Grid|Redraw)
Display(CycleClip|CycleCrosshair|Toggle45Degree|ToggleStartDirection)
Display(ToggleGrid|ToggleRubberBandMode|ToggleUniqueNames)
Display(ToggleMask|ToggleName|ToggleClearLine|ToggleFullPoly|ToggleSnapPin)
Display(ToggleThindraw|ToggleThindrawPoly|ToggleOrthoMove|ToggleLocalRef)
Display(ToggleCheckPlanes|ToggleShowDRC|ToggleAutoDRC)
Display(ToggleLiveRoute|LockNames|OnlyNames)
Display(Pinout|PinOrPadName)

Several display-related actions.

`NameOnPCB'

`Description'

`Value'
     Specify whether all elements show their name, description, or
     value.

`Redraw'
     Redraw the whole board.

`Toggle45Degree'
     When clear, lines can be drawn at any angle.  When set, lines are
     restricted to multiples of 45 degrees and requested lines may be
     broken up according to the clip setting.

`CycleClip'
     Changes the way lines are restricted to 45 degree increments.  The
     various settings are: straight only, orthogonal then angled, and
     angled then orthogonal.  If AllDirections is set, this action
     disables it.

`CycleCrosshair'
     Changes crosshair drawing.  Crosshair may accept form of 4-ray,
     8-ray and 12-ray cross.

`ToggleRubberBandMode'
     If set, moving an object moves all the lines attached to it too.

`ToggleStartDirection'
     If set, each time you set a point in a line, the Clip toggles
     between orth-angle and angle-ortho.

`ToggleUniqueNames'
     If set, you will not be permitted to change the name of an element
     to match that of another element.

`ToggleSnapPin'
     If set, pin centers and pad end points are treated as additional
     grid points that the cursor can snap to.

`ToggleLocalRef'
     If set, the mark is automatically set to the beginning of any
     move, so you can see the relative distance you've moved.

`ToggleThindraw'
     If set, objects on the screen are drawn as outlines (lines are
     drawn as center-lines).  This lets you see line endpoints hidden
     under pins, for example.

`ToggleThindrawPoly'
     If set, polygons on the screen are drawn as outlines.

`ToggleShowDRC'
     If set, pending objects (i.e. lines you're in the process of
     drawing) will be drawn with an outline showing how far away from
     other copper you need to be.

`ToggleLiveRoute'
     If set, the progress of the autorouter will be visible on the
     screen.

`ToggleAutoDRC'
     If set, you will not be permitted to make connections which violate
     the current DRC and netlist settings.

`ToggleCheckPlanes'
     If set, lines and arcs aren't drawn, which usually leaves just the
     polygons.  If you also disable all but the layer you're interested
     in, this allows you to check for isolated regions.

`ToggleOrthoMove'
     If set, the crosshair is only allowed to move orthogonally from its
     previous position.  I.e. you can move an element or line up, down,
     left, or right, but not up+left or down+right.

`ToggleName'
     Selects whether the pinouts show the pin names or the pin numbers.

`ToggleLockNames'
     If set, text will ignore left mouse clicks and actions that work on
     objects under the mouse. You can still select text with a lasso
     (left mouse drag) and perform actions on the selection.

`ToggleOnlyNames'
     If set, only text will be sensitive for mouse clicks and actions
     that work on objects under the mouse. You can still select other
     objects with a lasso (left mouse drag) and perform actions on the
     selection.

`ToggleMask'
     Turns the solder mask on or off.

`ToggleClearLine'
     When set, the clear-line flag causes new lines and arcs to have
     their "clear polygons" flag set, so they won't be electrically
     connected to any polygons they overlap.

`ToggleFullPoly'
     When set, the full-poly flag causes new polygons to have their
     "full polygon" flag set, so all parts of them will be displayed
     instead of only the biggest one.

`ToggleGrid'
     Resets the origin of the current grid to be wherever the mouse
     pointer is (not where the crosshair currently is).  If you provide
     two numbers after this, the origin is set to that coordinate.

`Grid'
     Toggles whether the grid is displayed or not.

`Pinout'
     Causes the pinout of the element indicated by the cursor to be
     displayed, usually in a separate window.

`PinOrPadName'
     Toggles whether the names of pins, pads, or (yes) vias will be
     displayed.  If the cursor is over an element, all of its pins and
     pads are affected.



File: pcb.info,  Node: djopt Action,  Next: DRC Action,  Prev: Display Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.27 djopt
------------

djopt(debumpify|unjaggy|simple|vianudge|viatrim|orthopull)
djopt(auto) - all of the above
djopt(miter)

Perform various optimizations on the current board.

   The different types of optimizations change your board in order to
reduce the total trace length and via count.

`debumpify'
     Looks for U-shaped traces that can be shortened or eliminated.

`unjaggy'
     Looks for corners which could be flipped to eliminate one or more
     corners (i.e. jaggy lines become simpler).

`simple'
     Removing uneeded vias, replacing two or more trace segments in a
     row with a single segment.  This is usually performed
     automatically after other optimizations.

`vianudge'
     Looks for vias where all traces leave in the same direction.
     Tries to move via in that direction to eliminate one of the traces
     (and thus a corner).

`viatrim'
     Looks for traces that go from via to via, where moving that trace
     to a different layer eliminates one or both vias.

`orthopull'
     Looks for chains of traces all going in one direction, with more
     traces orthogonal on one side than on the other.  Moves the chain
     in that direction, causing a net reduction in trace length,
     possibly eliminating traces and/or corners.

`splitlines'
     Looks for lines that pass through vias, pins, or pads, and splits
     them into separate lines so they can be managed separately.

`auto'
     Performs the above options, repeating until no further
     optimizations can be made.

`miter'
     Replaces 90 degree corners with a pair of 45 degree corners, to
     reduce RF losses and trace length.



File: pcb.info,  Node: DRC Action,  Next: DumpLibrary Action,  Prev: djopt Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.28 DRC
----------

DRC()

Invoke the DRC check.

   Note that the design rule check uses the current board rule settings,
not the current style settings.


File: pcb.info,  Node: DumpLibrary Action,  Next: elementlist Action,  Prev: DRC Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.29 DumpLibrary
------------------

DumpLibrary()

Display the entire contents of the libraries.


File: pcb.info,  Node: elementlist Action,  Next: elementsetattr Action,  Prev: DumpLibrary Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.30 elementlist
------------------

ElementList(Start|Done|Need,<refdes>,<footprint>,<value>)

Adds the given element if it doesn't already exist.

`Start'
     Indicates the start of an element list; call this before any Need
     actions.

`Need'
     Searches the board for an element with a matching refdes.

     If found, the value and footprint are updated.

     If not found, a new element is created with the given footprint
     and value.

`Done'
     Compares the list of elements needed since the most recent `start'
     with the list of elements actually on the board.  Any elements
     that weren't listed are selected, so that the user may delete them.



File: pcb.info,  Node: elementsetattr Action,  Next: EnableVendor Action,  Prev: elementlist Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.31 elementsetattr
---------------------

ElementSetAttr(refdes,name[,value])

Sets or clears an element-specific attribute.

   If a value is specified, the named attribute is added (if not already
present) or changed (if it is) to the given value.  If the value is not
specified, the given attribute is removed if present.


File: pcb.info,  Node: EnableVendor Action,  Next: execcommand Action,  Prev: elementsetattr Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.32 EnableVendor
-------------------

EnableVendor()

Enables automatic drill size mapping.

   When drill mapping is enabled, new instances of pins and vias will
have their drill holes mapped to one of the allowed drill sizes
specified in the currently loaded vendor drill table.  To enable drill
mapping, a vendor resource file containing a drill table must be loaded
first.


File: pcb.info,  Node: execcommand Action,  Next: ExecuteFile Action,  Prev: EnableVendor Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.33 execcommand
------------------

ExecCommand(command)

Runs a command.

   Runs the given command, which is a system executable.


File: pcb.info,  Node: ExecuteFile Action,  Next: Flip Action,  Prev: execcommand Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.34 ExecuteFile
------------------

ExecuteFile(filename)

Run actions from the given file.

   Lines starting with `#' are ignored.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Flip Action,  Next: FontEdit Action,  Prev: ExecuteFile Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.35 Flip
-----------

Flip(Object|Selected|SelectedElements)

Flip an element to the opposite side of the board.

   Note that the location of the element will be symmetric about the
cursor location; i.e. if the part you are pointing at will still be at
the same spot once the element is on the other side.  When flipping
multiple elements, this retains their positions relative to each other,
not their absolute positions on the board.


File: pcb.info,  Node: FontEdit Action,  Next: FontSave Action,  Prev: Flip Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.36 FontEdit
---------------

FontEdit()

Convert the current font to a PCB for editing.


File: pcb.info,  Node: FontSave Action,  Next: FreeRotateBuffer Action,  Prev: FontEdit Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.37 FontSave
---------------

FontSave()

Convert the current PCB back to a font.


File: pcb.info,  Node: FreeRotateBuffer Action,  Next: GlobalPuller Action,  Prev: FontSave Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.38 FreeRotateBuffer
-----------------------

FreeRotateBuffer([Angle])

Rotates the current paste buffer contents by the specified angle.  The
angle is given in degrees.  If no angle is given, the user is prompted
for one.

   Rotates the contents of the pastebuffer by an arbitrary angle.  If no
angle is given, the user is prompted for one.


File: pcb.info,  Node: GlobalPuller Action,  Next: h Action,  Prev: FreeRotateBuffer Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.39 GlobalPuller
-------------------

GlobalPuller()

Pull all traces tight.


File: pcb.info,  Node: h Action,  Next: Import Action,  Prev: GlobalPuller Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.40 h
--------

h

Print a help message for commands.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Import Action,  Next: l Action,  Prev: h Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.41 Import
-------------

Import()
Import([gnetlist|make[,source,source,...]])
Import(setnewpoint[,(mark|center|X,Y)])
Import(setdisperse,D,units)

Import schematics.

   Imports element and netlist data from the schematics (or some other
source).  The first parameter, which is optional, is the mode.  If not
specified, the `import::mode' attribute in the PCB is used.  `gnetlist'
means gnetlist is used to obtain the information from the schematics.
`make' invokes `make', assuming the user has a `Makefile' in the
current directory.  The `Makefile' will be invoked with the following
variables set:

`PCB'
     The name of the .pcb file

`SRCLIST'
     A space-separated list of source files

`OUT'
     The name of the file in which to put the command script, which may
     contain any `Pcb' actions.  By default, this is a temporary file
     selected by `Pcb', but if you specify an `import::outfile'
     attribute, that file name is used instead (and not automatically
     deleted afterwards).


   The target specified to be built is the first of these that apply:

   * The target specified by an `import::target' attribute.

   * The output file specified by an `import::outfile' attribute.

   * If nothing else is specified, the target is `pcb_import'.


   If you specify an `import::makefile' attribute, then "-f <that
file>" will be added to the command line.

   If you specify the mode, you may also specify the source files
(schematics).  If you do not specify any, the list of schematics is
obtained by reading the `import::srcN' attributes (like `import::src0',
`import::src1', etc).

   For compatibility with future extensions to the import file format,
the generated file _must not_ start with the two characters `#%'.

   If a temporary file is needed the `TMPDIR' environment variable is
used to select its location.

   Note that the programs `gnetlist' and `make' may be overridden by
the user via the `make-program' and `gnetlist' `pcb' settings (i.e. in
`~/.pcb/settings' or on the command line).

   If `Pcb' cannot determine which schematic(s) to import from, the GUI
is called to let user choose (see `ImportGUI()').

   Note that Import() doesn't delete anything - after an Import,
elements which shouldn't be on the board are selected and may be
removed once it's determined that the deletion is appropriate.

   If `Import()' is called with `setnewpoint', then the location of new
components can be specified.  This is where parts show up when they're
added to the board.  The default is the center of the board.

`Import(setnewpoint)'
     Prompts the user to click on the board somewhere, uses that point.
     If called by a hotkey, uses the current location of the crosshair.

`Import(setnewpoint,mark)'
     Uses the location of the mark.  If no mark is present, the point is
     not changed.

`Import(setnewpoint,center)'
     Resets the point to the center of the board.

`Import(setnewpoint,X,Y,units)'
     Sets the point to the specific coordinates given.  Example:
     `Import(setnewpoint,50,25,mm)'


   Note that the X and Y locations are stored in attributes named
`import::newX' and `import::newY' so you could change them manually if
you wished.

   Calling `Import(setdisperse,D,units)' sets how much the newly placed
elements are dispersed relative to the set point.  For example,
`Import(setdisperse,10,mm)' will offset each part randomly up to 10mm
away from the point.  The default dispersion is 1/10th of the smallest
board dimension.  Dispersion is saved in the `import::disperse'
attribute.


File: pcb.info,  Node: l Action,  Next: le Action,  Prev: Import Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.42 l
--------

l [name]

Loads layout data.

   Loads a new datafile (layout) and, if confirmed, overwrites any
existing unsaved data.  The filename and the searchpath (_filePath_)
are passed to the command defined by _fileCommand_.  If no filename is
specified a file select box will popup.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: le Action,  Next: LoadFootprint Action,  Prev: l Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.43 le
---------

le [name]

Loads an element into the current buffer.

   The filename and the searchpath (_elementPath_) are passed to the
command defined by _elementCommand_.  If no filename is specified a
file select box will popup.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: LoadFootprint Action,  Next: LoadFrom Action,  Prev: le Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.44 LoadFootprint
--------------------

LoadFootprint(filename[,refdes,value])

Loads a single footprint by name.

   Loads a single footprint by name, rather than by reference or through
the library.  If a refdes and value are specified, those are inserted
into the footprint as well.  The footprint remains in the paste buffer.


File: pcb.info,  Node: LoadFrom Action,  Next: LoadVendorFrom Action,  Prev: LoadFootprint Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.45 LoadFrom
---------------

LoadFrom(Layout|LayoutToBuffer|ElementToBuffer|Netlist|Revert,filename)

Load layout data from a file.

   This action assumes you know what the filename is.  The various GUIs
should have a similar `Load' action where the filename is optional, and
will provide their own file selection mechanism to let you choose the
file name.

`Layout'
     Loads an entire PCB layout, replacing the current one.

`LayoutToBuffer'
     Loads an entire PCB layout to the paste buffer.

`ElementToBuffer'
     Loads the given element file into the paste buffer.  Element files
     contain only a single `Element' definition, such as the "newlib"
     library uses.

`Netlist'
     Loads a new netlist, replacing any current netlist.

`Revert'
     Re-loads the current layout from its disk file, reverting any
     changes you may have made.



File: pcb.info,  Node: LoadVendorFrom Action,  Next: m Action,  Prev: LoadFrom Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.46 LoadVendorFrom
---------------------

LoadVendorFrom(filename)

Loads the specified vendor resource file.

FILENAME
     Name of the vendor resource file.  If not specified, the user will
     be prompted to enter one.


File: pcb.info,  Node: m Action,  Next: MarkCrosshair Action,  Prev: LoadVendorFrom Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.47 m
--------

m [name]

Loads a layout into the current buffer.

   The filename and the searchpath (_filePath_) are passed to the
command defined by _fileCommand_.  If no filename is specified a file
select box will popup.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: MarkCrosshair Action,  Next: Message Action,  Prev: m Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.48 MarkCrosshair
--------------------

MarkCrosshair()
MarkCrosshair(Center)

Set/Reset the Crosshair mark.

   The "mark" is a small X-shaped target on the display which is
treated like a second origin (the normal origin is the upper let corner
of the board).  The GUI will display a second set of coordinates for
this mark, which tells you how far you are from it.

   If no argument is given, the mark is toggled - disabled if it was
enabled, or enabled at the current cursor position of disabled.  If the
`Center' argument is given, the mark is moved to the current cursor
location.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Message Action,  Next: MinClearGap Action,  Prev: MarkCrosshair Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.49 Message
--------------

Message(message)

Writes a message to the log window.

   This action displays a message to the log window.  This action is
primarily provided for use by other programs which may interface with
PCB.  If multiple arguments are given, each one is sent to the log
window followed by a newline.


File: pcb.info,  Node: MinClearGap Action,  Next: MinMaskGap Action,  Prev: Message Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.50 MinClearGap
------------------

MinClearGap(delta)
MinClearGap(Selected, delta)

Ensures that polygons are a minimum distance from objects.

   Checks all specified objects, and increases the polygon clearance if
needed to ensure a minimum distance between their edges and the polygon
edges.


File: pcb.info,  Node: MinMaskGap Action,  Next: Mode Action,  Prev: MinClearGap Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.51 MinMaskGap
-----------------

MinMaskGap(delta)
MinMaskGap(Selected, delta)

Ensures the mask is a minimum distance from pins and pads.

   Checks all specified pins and/or pads, and increases the mask if
needed to ensure a minimum distance between the pin or pad edge and the
mask edge.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Mode Action,  Next: MorphPolygon Action,  Prev: MinMaskGap Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.52 Mode
-----------

Mode(Arc|Arrow|Copy|InsertPoint|Line|Lock|Move|None|PasteBuffer)
Mode(Polygon|Rectangle|Remove|Rotate|Text|Thermal|Via)
Mode(Notify|Release|Cancel|Stroke)
Mode(Save|Restore)

Change or use the tool mode.

`Arc'
`Arrow'
`Copy'
`InsertPoint'
`Line'
`Lock'
`Move'
`None'
`PasteBuffer'
`Polygon'
`Rectangle'
`Remove'
`Rotate'

`Thermal'
`Via'
     Select the indicated tool.

`Notify'
     Called when you press the mouse button, or move the mouse.

`Release'
     Called when you release the mouse button.

`Cancel'
     Cancels any pending tool activity, allowing you to restart
     elsewhere.  For example, this allows you to start a new line
     rather than attach a line to the previous line.

`Escape'
     Similar to Cancel but calling this action a second time will return
     to the Arrow tool.

`Stroke'
     If your `pcb' was built with libstroke, this invokes the stroke
     input method.  If not, this will restart a drawing mode if you were
     drawing, else it will select objects.

`Save'
     Remembers the current tool.

`Restore'
     Restores the tool to the last saved tool.

G.1.53 MorphPolygon
-------------------

MorphPolygon(Object|Selected)

Converts dead polygon islands into separate polygons.

   If a polygon is divided into unconnected "islands", you can use this
command to convert the otherwise disappeared islands into separate
polygons. Be sure the cursor is over a portion of the polygon that
remains visible. Very small islands that may flake off are
automatically deleted.


File: pcb.info,  Node: MoveLayer Action,  Next: MoveObject Action,  Prev: MorphPolygon Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.54 MoveLayer
----------------

MoveLayer(old,new)

Moves/Creates/Deletes Layers.

   Moves a layer, creates a new layer, or deletes a layer.

`old'
     The is the layer number to act upon.  Allowed values are:
    `c'
          Currently selected layer.

    `-1'
          Create a new layer.

    `number'
          An existing layer number.


`new'
     Specifies where to move the layer to.  Allowed values are:
    `-1'
          Deletes the layer.

    `up'
          Moves the layer up.

    `down'
          Moves the layer down.

    `c'
          Creates a new layer.




File: pcb.info,  Node: MoveObject Action,  Next: MoveToCurrentLayer Action,  Prev: MoveLayer Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.55 MoveObject
-----------------

MoveObject(X,Y,dim)

Moves the object under the crosshair.

   The `X' and `Y' are treated like `delta' is for many other objects.
For each, if it's prefixed by `+' or `-', then that amount is relative.
Otherwise, it's absolute.  Units can be `mil' or `mm'; if unspecified,
units are PCB's internal units, currently 1/100 mil.


File: pcb.info,  Node: MoveToCurrentLayer Action,  Next: Netlist Action,  Prev: MoveObject Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.56 MoveToCurrentLayer
-------------------------

MoveToCurrentLayer(Object|SelectedObjects)

Moves objects to the current layer.

   Note that moving an element from a component layer to a solder layer,
or from solder to component, won't automatically flip it.  Use the
`Flip()' action to do that.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Netlist Action,  Next: New Action,  Prev: MoveToCurrentLayer Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.57 Netlist
--------------

Net(find|select|rats|norats|clear[,net[,pin]])
Net(freeze|thaw|forcethaw)
Net(add,net,pin)

Perform various actions on netlists.

   Each of these actions apply to a specified set of nets.  NET and PIN
are patterns which match one or more nets or pins; these patterns may
be full names or regular expressions.  If an exact match is found, it
is the only match; if no exact match is found, _then_ the pattern is
tried as a regular expression.

   If neither NET nor PIN are specified, all nets apply.  If NET is
specified but not PIN, all nets matching NET apply.  If both are
specified, nets which match NET and contain a pin matching PIN apply.

`find'
     Nets which apply are marked _found_ and are drawn in the
     `connected-color' color.

`select'
     Nets which apply are selected.

`rats'
     Nets which apply are marked as available for the rats nest.

`norats'
     Nets which apply are marked as not available for the rats nest.

`clear'
     Clears the netlist.

`add'
     Add the given pin to the given netlist, creating either if needed.

`sort'
     Called after a list of add's, this sorts the netlist.

`freeze'
`thaw'
`forcethaw'
     Temporarily prevents changes to the netlist from being reflected in
     the GUI.  For example, if you need to make multiple changes, you
     freeze the netlist, make the changes, then thaw it.  Note that
     freeze/thaw requests may nest, with the netlist being fully thawed
     only when all pending freezes are thawed.  You can bypass the
     nesting by using forcethaw, which resets the freeze count and
     immediately updates the GUI.

G.1.59 OptAutoOnly
------------------

OptAutoOnly()

Toggles the optimize-only-autorouted flag.

   The original purpose of the trace optimizer was to clean up the
traces created by the various autorouters that have been used with PCB.
When a board has a mix of autorouted and carefully hand-routed traces,
you don't normally want the optimizer to move your hand-routed traces.
But, sometimes you do.  By default, the optimizer only optimizes
autorouted traces.  This action toggles that setting, so that you can
optimize hand-routed traces also.

G.1.60 PasteBuffer
------------------

PasteBuffer(AddSelected|Clear|1..MAX_BUFFER)
PasteBuffer(Rotate, 1..3)
PasteBuffer(Convert|Save|Restore|Mirror)
PasteBuffer(ToLayout, X, Y, units)

Various operations on the paste buffer.

   There are a number of paste buffers; the actual limit is a
compile-time constant `MAX_BUFFER' in `globalconst.h'.  It is currently
`5'.  One of these is the "current" paste buffer, often referred to as
"the" paste buffer.

`AddSelected'
     Copies the selected objects to the current paste buffer.

`Clear'
     Remove all objects from the current paste buffer.

`Convert'
     Convert the current paste buffer to an element.  Vias are
     converted to pins, lines are converted to pads.

`Restore'
     Convert any elements in the paste buffer back to vias and lines.

`Mirror'
     Flip all objects in the paste buffer vertically (up/down flip).
     To mirror horizontally, combine this with rotations.

`Rotate'
     Rotates the current buffer.  The number to pass is 1..3, where 1
     means 90 degrees counter clockwise, 2 means 180 degrees, and 3
     means 90 degrees clockwise (270 CCW).

`Save'
     Saves any elements in the current buffer to the indicated file.

`ToLayout'
     Pastes any elements in the current buffer to the indicated X, Y
     coordinates in the layout.  The `X' and `Y' are treated like
     `delta' is for many other objects.  For each, if it's prefixed by
     `+' or `-', then that amount is relative to the last location.
     Otherwise, it's absolute.  Units can be `mil' or `mm'; if
     unspecified, units are PCB's internal units, currently 1/100 mil.

`1..MAX_BUFFER'
     Selects the given buffer to be the current paste buffer.

G.1.61 Polygon
--------------

Polygon(Close|PreviousPoint)

Some polygon related stuff.

   Polygons need a special action routine to make life easier.

`Close'
     Creates the final segment of the polygon.  This may fail if
     clipping to 45 degree lines is switched on, in which case a
     warning is issued.

`PreviousPoint'
     Resets the newly entered corner to the previous one. The Undo
     action will call Polygon(PreviousPoint) when appropriate to do so.



File: pcb.info,  Node: Puller Action,  Next: q Action,  Prev: Polygon Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.62 Puller
-------------

Puller()

Pull an arc-line junction tight.

   The `Puller()' action is a special-purpose optimization.  When
invoked while the crosshair is over the junction of an arc and a line,
it will adjust the arc's angle and the connecting line's endpoint such
that the line intersects the arc at a tangent.  In the example below,
the left side is "before" with the black target marking where to put
the crosshair:

       [image src="puller.png" alt="Example of how puller works" ]

The right side is "after" with the black target marking where the
arc-line intersection was moved to.

G.1.63 q
--------

q

Quits the application after confirming.

   If you have unsaved changes, you will be prompted to confirm (or
save) before quitting.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.

G.1.66 Redo
-----------

Redo()

Redo recent"undo"operations.

   This routine allows you to recover from the last undo command.  You
might want to do this if you thought that undo was going to revert
something other than what it actually did (in case you are confused
about which operations are un-doable), or if you have been backing up
through a long undo list and over-shoot your stopping point.  Any
change that is made since the undo in question will trim the redo list.
For example if you add ten lines, then undo three of them you could use
redo to put them back, but if you move a line on the board before
performing the redo, you will lose the ability to "redo" the three
"undone" lines.

G.1.72 rn
---------

rn [name]

Reads netlist.

   If no filename is given a file select box will pop up.  The file is
read via the command defined by the _RatCommand_ resource. The command
must send its output to _stdout_.

   Netlists are used for generating rat's nests (see *note Rats Nest::)
and for verifying the board layout (which is also accomplished by the
_Ratsnest_ command).

Select(Convert)

Toggles or sets the selection.

`ElementByName'

`ObjectByName'

`PadByName'

`PinByName'

`TextByName'

`ViaByName'

`NetByName'
     These all rely on having a regular expression parser built into

     a pattern, and all objects that match the pattern and are of the
     type specified are selected.

`Object'

`ToggleObject'
     Selects the object under the cursor.

`Block'
     Selects all objects in a rectangle indicated by the cursor.

`All'
     Selects all objects on the board.

-----------------

SetOctagon(Object|ToggleObject|SelectedElements|Selected)

Sets the octagon-flag of objects.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.

G.1.80 SetSame
--------------

SetSame()

Sets current layer and sizes to match indicated item.

   When invoked over any line, arc, polygon, or via, this changes the
current layer to be the layer that item is on, and changes the current
sizes (thickness, keepaway, drill, etc) according to that item.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetSquare Action,  Next: SetThermal Action,  Prev: SetSame Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.81 SetSquare
----------------

SetSquare(ToggleObject|SelectedElements|SelectedPins)

sets the square-flag of objects.

   Note that `Pins' means pins and pads.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetThermal Action,  Next: SetValue Action,  Prev: SetSquare Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.82 SetThermal
-----------------

SetThermal(Object|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected, Style)

Set the thermal (on the current layer) of pins or vias to the given
style.  Style = 0 means no thermal.  Style = 1 has diagonal fingers
with sharp edges.  Style = 2 has horizontal and vertical fingers with
sharp edges.  Style = 3 is a solid connection to the plane.Style = 4
has diagonal fingers with rounded edges.  Style = 5 has horizontal and
vertical fingers with rounded edges.

   This changes how/whether pins or vias connect to any rectangle or
polygon on the current layer. The first argument can specify one
object, or all selected pins, or all selected vias, or all selected
pins and vias.  The second argument specifies the style of connection.
There are 5 possibilities: 0 - no connection, 1 - 45 degree fingers
with sharp edges, 2 - horizontal & vertical fingers with sharp edges, 3
- solid connection, 4 - 45 degree fingers with rounded corners, 5 -
horizontal & vertical fingers with rounded corners.

   Pins and Vias may have thermals whether or not there is a polygon
available to connect with. However, they will have no effect without
the polygon.

Toggles the state of automatic drill size mapping.

   When drill mapping is enabled, new instances of pins and vias will
have their drill holes mapped to one of the allowed drill sizes
specified in the currently loaded vendor drill table.  To enable drill
mapping, a vendor resource file containing a drill table must be loaded
first.

G.1.86 Undo
-----------

Undo()
Undo(ClearList)

Undo recent changes.

   The unlimited undo feature of `Pcb' allows you to recover from most
operations that materially affect you work.  Calling `Undo()' without
any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo) operation. `ClearList'
is used to release the allocated memory. `ClearList' is called whenever
a new layout is started or loaded. See also `Redo' and `Atomic'.

   Note that undo groups operations by serial number; changes with the
same serial number will be undone (or redone) as a group.  See `Atomic'.

G.3.4 gtk Cursor
----------------

Cursor(Type,DeltaUp,DeltaRight,Units)

N_("Move the cursor.");

   This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take
coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the
user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive DELTAUP may move the cursor
towards the board origin if the board is inverted.

   Type is one of `Pan' or `Warp'.  `Pan' causes the viewport to move
such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor.  `Warp' causes the
mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair.

   UNITS can be one of the following:

`mil'
`mm'
     The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.

`grid'
     The cursor is moved by that many grid points.

`view'
     The values are percentages of the viewport's view.  Thus, a pan of

G.3.16 gtk SwapSides
--------------------

SwapSides(|v|h|r)

N_("Swaps the side of the board you're looking at.");

   This action changes the way you view the board.

`v'
     Flips the board over vertically (up/down).

`h'
     Flips the board over horizontally (left/right), like flipping
     pages in a book.

`r'
     Rotates the board 180 degrees without changing sides.


   If no argument is given, the board isn't moved but the opposite side
is shown.

   Normally, this action changes which pads and silk layer are drawn as
true silk, and which are drawn as the "invisible" layer.  It also
determines which solder mask you see.

   As a special case, if the layer group for the side you're looking at
is visible and currently active, and the layer group for the opposite
is not visible (i.e. disabled), then this action will also swap which
layer group is visible and active, effectively swapping the "working
side" of the board.

G.3.17 gtk ToggleView
---------------------

ToggleView(1..MAXLAYER)
ToggleView(layername)
ToggleView(Silk|Rats|Pins|Vias|Mask|BackSide)

Toggle the visibility of the specified layer or layer group.

   If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first
layer is `1', etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified
by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group
containing that layer is toggled.

   If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components
(silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the
same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer.


File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk Zoom Action,  Prev: gtk ToggleView Action,  Up: gtk actions

G.3.18 gtk Zoom
---------------

Zoom()
Zoom(factor)

N_("Various zoom factor changes."); Changes the zoom (magnification) of
the view of the board.  If no arguments are passed, the view is scaled
such that the board just fits inside the visible window (i.e. "view
all").  Otherwise, FACTOR specifies a change in zoom factor.  It may be
prefixed by `+', `-', or `=' to change how the zoom factor is modified.
The FACTOR is a floating point number, such as `1.5' or `0.75'.

`+FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn smaller; more
     of the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause
     the board to be drawn bigger; less of the board will be visible.

`-FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn bigger; less of
     the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the
     board to be drawn smaller; more of the board will be visible.

`=FACTOR'
     The FACTOR is an absolute zoom factor; the unit for this value is
     "PCB units per screen pixel".  Since PCB units are 0.01 mil, a
     FACTOR of 1000 means 10 mils (0.01 in) per pixel, or 100 DPI,
     about the actual resolution of most screens - resulting in an
     "actual size" board.  Similarly, a FACTOR of 100 gives you a 10x
     actual size.


   Note that zoom factors of zero are silently ignored.

G.4.4 lesstif Benchmark
-----------------------

   This action is used to speed-test the Lesstif graphics subsystem.  It
redraws the current screen as many times as possible in ten seconds.
It reports the amount of time needed to draw the screen once.


File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif Command Action,  Next: lesstif Cursor Action,  Prev: lesstif Benchmark Action,  Up: lesstif actions

G.4.5 lesstif Command
---------------------

Command()

Displays the command line input window.

   The command window allows the user to manually enter actions to be
executed.  Action syntax can be done one of two ways:

`'
     Follow the action name by an open parenthesis, arguments separated
     by commas, end with a close parenthesis.  Example: `Abc(1,2,3)'

`'
     Separate the action name and arguments by spaces.  Example: `Abc 1
     2 3'.


   The first option allows you to have arguments with spaces in them,
but the second is more "natural" to type for most people.

   Note that action names are not case sensitive, but arguments normally
are.  However, most actions will check for "keywords" in a case
insensitive way.

   There are three ways to finish with the command window.  If you press
the `Enter' key, the command is invoked, the window goes away, and the
next time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you press the
`Esc' key, the window goes away without invoking anything, and the next
time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you change focus
away from the command window (i.e. click on some other window), the
command window goes away but the next time you bring it up it resumes
entering the command you were entering before.

G.4.6 lesstif Cursor
--------------------

Cursor(Type,DeltaUp,DeltaRight,Units)

Move the cursor.

   This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take
coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the
user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive DELTAUP may move the cursor
towards the board origin if the board is inverted.

   Type is one of `Pan' or `Warp'.  `Pan' causes the viewport to move
such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor.  `Warp' causes the
mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair.

   UNITS can be one of the following:

`mil'
`mm'
     The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.

`grid'
     The cursor is moved by that many grid points.

`view'
     The values are percentages of the viewport's view.  Thus, a pan of
     `100' would scroll the viewport by exactly the width of the
     current view.

`board'
     The values are percentages of the board size.  Thus, a move of
     `50,50' moves you halfway across the board.

File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif SwapSides Action,  Next: lesstif ToggleView Action,  Prev: lesstif SetUnits Action,  Up: lesstif actions

G.4.26 lesstif SwapSides
------------------------

SwapSides(|v|h|r)

Swaps the side of the board you're looking at.

   This action changes the way you view the board.

`v'
     Flips the board over vertically (up/down).

`h'
     Flips the board over horizontally (left/right), like flipping
     pages in a book.

`r'
     Rotates the board 180 degrees without changing sides.


   If no argument is given, the board isn't moved but the opposite side
is shown.

   Normally, this action changes which pads and silk layer are drawn as
true silk, and which are drawn as the "invisible" layer.  It also
determines which solder mask you see.

   As a special case, if the layer group for the side you're looking at
is visible and currently active, and the layer group for the opposite
is not visible (i.e. disabled), then this action will also swap which
layer group is visible and active, effectively swapping the "working
side" of the board.

G.4.27 lesstif ToggleView
-------------------------

ToggleView(1..MAXLAYER)
ToggleView(layername)
ToggleView(Silk|Rats|Pins|Vias|Mask|BackSide)

Toggle the visibility of the specified layer or layer group.

   If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first
layer is `1', etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified
by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group
containing that layer is toggled.

   If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components
(silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the
same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer.


File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif Zoom Action,  Prev: lesstif ToggleView Action,  Up: lesstif actions

G.4.28 lesstif Zoom
-------------------

Zoom()
Zoom(factor)

Various zoom factor changes.

   Changes the zoom (magnification) of the view of the board.  If no
arguments are passed, the view is scaled such that the board just fits
inside the visible window (i.e. "view all").  Otherwise, FACTOR
specifies a change in zoom factor.  It may be prefixed by `+', `-', or
`=' to change how the zoom factor is modified.  The FACTOR is a
floating point number, such as `1.5' or `0.75'.

`+FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn smaller; more
     of the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause
     the board to be drawn bigger; less of the board will be visible.

`-FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn bigger; less of
     the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the
     board to be drawn smaller; more of the board will be visible.

`=FACTOR'
     The FACTOR is an absolute zoom factor; the unit for this value is
     "PCB units per screen pixel".  Since PCB units are 0.01 mil, a
     FACTOR of 1000 means 10 mils (0.01 in) per pixel, or 100 DPI,
     about the actual resolution of most screens - resulting in an
     "actual size" board.  Similarly, a FACTOR of 100 gives you a 10x
     actual size.


   Note that zoom factors of zero are silently ignored.

Appendix H Glossary
*******************

Footprint
     The pattern of metal, silkscreen, soldermask relief, and drills
     which defines where you place a component on a circuit board.
     Footprints are the placed by the user onto the PC board during the
     placement phase of PCB layout.

Gerber File
     The file format used in the industry to convey a board database to
     the manufacturer is RS-274X (which replaces the now obsolete
     RS-274D format).  This file format was originally developed by
     Gerber for their photo plotters and thus RS-274D and RS-274X
     format files are often times refered to as "Gerber" files.

Thermal, Thermal Relief
     A thermal relief is a way of connecting a pin to a ground or power
     plane.  Instead of directly connecting to the plane, small "spokes"
     are used to increase the thermal resistance between the pin and
     the plane.  Often times these connections are refered to as simply
     a thermal.  By increasing the thermal resistance to the plane, it
     becomes easier to solder to the pin.  In the drawing below, the
     pin on the left is connected to the polygon using a solid
     connection with no thermal relief, the middle pin is connected
     using a thermal, while the pin on the right has no connection to
     the polygon.  In PCB, the "Thermal" Tool is used to make both a
     solid connection and one with thermal relief (see *note Polygon
     Objects::).
