History
*******

`Pcb' is a handy tool for laying out printed circuit boards.

   `Pcb' was first written by Thomas Nau for an Atari ST in 1990 and
ported to `UNIX' and `X11' in 1994.  It was not intended as a
professional layout system, but as a tool which supports people who do
some home-developing of hardware.

   The second release 1.2 included menus for the first time. This made
`Pcb' easier to use and thus a more important tool.

   Release 1.3 introduced undo for highly-destructive commands, more
straightforward action handling and scalable fonts. Layer-groups were
introduced to group signal-layers together.

   Release 1.4 provided support for add-on device drivers.  Two layers
(the solder and the component side) were added to support SMD elements.
The handling of libraries was also improved in 1.4.1. Support for
additional devices like GERBER plotters started in 1.4.4. The undo
feature was expanded and the redo-feature added in 1.4.5.

   harry eaton took over pcb development beginning with Release 1.5,
although he contributed some code beginning with Release 1.4.3

   Release 1.5 provides support for rats-nest generation from simple net
lists.  It also allows for automatic clearances around pins that pierce
a polygon.  A variety of other enhancements including a Gerber RS-274X
driver and NC drill file generation have also been added.

   Release 1.6 provides automatic screen updates of changed regions.
This should eliminate most of the need for the redraw ((_R_ key).  Also
some changes to what order items under the cursor are selected were
made for better consistency - it is no longer possible to accidentally
move a line or line point that is completely obscured by a polygon
laying over top of it.  Larger objects on the upper most layers can be
selected ahead of smaller objects on lower layers.  These changes make
operations more intuitive.  A new mode of line creation was added that
creates two line on 45 degree angles with a single click. The actual
outline of the prospective line(s) are now shown during line creation.
An arc creation mode was added.  Drawn arcs are quarter circles and can
be useful for high frequency controlled impedance lines.  (You can have
eighth circle arc if the source is compiled with -DARC45, but be aware
that the ends of such arcs can never intersect a grid point).  Two new
flags for pins and vias were created - one indicates that the pin or
via is purely a drill hole and has no copper annulus.  You can only
toggle this flag for vias - for elements, it must be an integral part
of the element definition.  The other flag controls whether the pad
will be round or octagonal.  There is also now a feature for converting
the contents of a buffer into an element.

   Release 1.6.1 added the ability to make groups of action commands
bound to a single X11 event to be undone by a single undo. Also a
simple design rule checker was added - it checks for minimum spacing
and overlap rules. Plus many fixes for bugs introduced with the many
changes of 1.6

   Release 1.7 added support for routing tracks through polygons
without touching them. It also added support for unplated drill files,
and drawing directly on the silk layer. A Netlist window for easily
working with netlist was also added.

   Release 2.0 adds an auto-router, a new simpler library mechanism,
much improved support for graphically creating (and editing) elements,
viewable solder-mask layers (and editing), snap to pins and pads,
netlist entry by drawing rats, element files (and libraries) that can
contain whole sub-layouts, metric grids, improved user interface, a GNU
autoconf/automake based build system, and a host of other improvements.

2 Introduction
**************

Each layout consists of several, mostly independent, objects. This
chapter gives an overview of the object types and their relationship to
each other.  For a complete description of how to use `Pcb', refer to
*note Getting Started::.  The layout is generated on-screen on a grid
that can have its origin at any desired location.  The X coordinate
increases to the right, Y increases down to the bottom.  All distances
and sizes in `Pcb' are measured in mils (0.001 inch).  One unit on the
coordinate display is one mil in distance on the board.  The grid may
be set on a metric pitch, but is only correct to within the nearest +/-
0.01 mil because `Pcb' stores all dimensions as integer multiples of
1/100 of a mil or 0.00001 inch.

   The sections in this chapter are sorted by the order of appearance
of the objects within a layout file.

* Menu:

* Symbol Objects::         Information about fonts and symbols.
* Via Objects::            Vias and pins connect layers.
* Element Objects::        Element, the basic type of circuits.
* Layer Objects::          A `container' for lines, text...
* Line Objects::           Tracks on the board
* Arc Objects::            Curved tracks
* Polygon Objects::        Planes and such
* Text Objects::           Objects to add symbols to your board.
* Net Objects::            Describes the desired connections on the board.

2.1 Symbols
===========

The top object is the layout itself. It uses a set of symbols that
resides at the first logical level. Each symbol is uniquely identified
by a seven bit `ASCII' code. All layout objects share the same set of
symbols. These symbols are used to form text objects on the silkscreen
and copper layers.  Undefined symbols are drawn as filled rectangles.

   Every font file is preprocessed by a user-defined command when it is
loaded.  For details see `fontCommand', *note Resources::.

2.2 Vias
========

Vias provide through-hole connectivity across all layers.  While vias
look a lot like element pins, don't use vias for adding elements to the
layout, even if that seems easier than creating a new element. The
default solder-mask will cover over vias, so you won't be able to
solder to them.  Of course, you can change this so that vias also have
solder-mask cut-outs, but it is not the default.  Vias are also useful
for defining arbitrary drill points such as those used for mounting a
board. Vias used in this way have a special flag set so that they have
no annular copper ring, and also appear in the unplated drill file.
_Ctrl-H_ key over a via switches it between being a pure-mounting hole
and a regular via.  You can assign a name to a via, which is useful
during the creation of new element definitions.  Each via exists on all
copper layers. (_i.e._ blind and buried vias are not supported)


File: pcb.info,  Node: Element Objects,  Next: Layer Objects,  Prev: Via Objects,  Up: Intro

2.3 Elements
============

Elements represent the components on a board.  Elements are loaded from
`ASCII' coded files in a similar manner to the layout file itself, or
from the library selector window.  An element is composed of lines and
arcs on the silk-screen layer (used to define the package outline), pins
(or pads for SMD) and three labels that define the description, the
element's layout-name (which also appears on the silk-screen layer) and
its value. You can choose which of the names are displayed on the screen
with the Screen menu; however, the silk screen in the printout will
always show the layout-name.  Element pins are contained on the first
logical level and so reside on all layers, but the pads of surface-mount
elements reside on only the component or solder layers. An element can
have a mixture of pins, pads (on one or both sides), and mounting holes.

   A mark is used to position the element with respect to the cross
hair during pasting.  The mark will lie on a grid point when the element
is positioned.  The mark is drawn as a small diamond shape, but is only
visible when _both_ the `silk' and `pins/pads' layers are visible.  All
parts of an element are treated as one unit, except for the name.  It
is not possible to delete a single pin or move only part of an element
on the layout.  You can resize separate pieces of an element, but doing
so is usually a bad idea. You can move/rotate the element name
independently of the element it belongs to. When you move an element
name, a line is draw from the cursor to the element mark so it is easy
to tell which element the name belongs to.

   Each pin and pad has two string identifiers, one is the "name" which
is a functional description of the pin (_e.g._ "clock in") and the
other is the "number" of the pin which is used to identify it in a
netlist. The "number" is usually an integer, but it can be any string.
You can edit the "name" of each pin of an element, but the "number" is
embedded in the element definition and is determined when the new
element is first created.  Pads are similar to lines on a layer but
they must be oriented either vertically or horizontally.  Pads can have
either rounded or square ends. Pins can be round, square, or octagonal.

   Elements are supported by several special layers: `silk',
`pins/pads' and `far-side'.  The `silk' layer shows the package outline
and also holds legend text and element names. The `pins/pads' layer is
used to toggle whether the element's pins and pads are displayed. The
`far-side' layer controls visibility of objects (silkscreen and pads)
that are on the far (_i.e._ not currently viewed) side of the board.

   The "oldlib" style of footprint libraries distributed with `Pcb'
rely upon the M4 macro processor.  M4 is typically installed under the
name `m4' on most unix-like operating systems.  It is recommended that
you use the GNU version of M4 to avoid limitations found in some vendor
implementations.  See the m4 man page on your system for more
information.  Every element file is preprocessed by a user-defined
command when the file is read.  For details see `elementCommand', *note
Resources::. `m4', the default value of `elementCommand', allows you to
create libraries for package definitions that are shared by all
elements.  The old element libraries distributed with `Pcb' expect `m4'
or an equivalent to be the _elementCommand_. The new library scheme
simply has each element stored in a self-contained file, so there is no
need to learn `m4' to add to the libraries.

   `Pcb' can create a list of all connections from one (or all)
elements to the others or a list of unconnected pins.  It can also
verify the layout connections against a netlist file.  The element's
`layout-name' is the name used to identify the element in a netlist
file (see *note Netlist File::).

   The old libraries, or very old (pre-1.6) layout files may have
incorrect pin numbering since there was no concept of pin numbers when
they were created. `Pcb' uses the order of appearance of the pin
definitions in the layout or library file if it uses the old format,
but there is no guarantee that it will be correct for these old objects.

   Be aware that a few of the old library parts may still be incorrectly
implemented regarding pin-numbering.  All of the DIL (Dual-
Inline-Pins) parts are correct and most of the others are too, but you
should verify the pin numbering of any non-DIL part before using an old
library part.  (use the `generate object report' in the Info menu to
see what `Pcb' thinks a pin's number is) All of the old library names
begin with a ~, so you can easily identify them.  The old libraries
also _may_ contain other sorts of errors, including incorrect pin
spacing, silkscreen overlapping solder areas, etc.  Check carefully any
element in the old library before using it!  As the new library grows,
the old library will be pared down to at least remove all of the
elements with errors, but this will take time.

   You can make your own element definitions graphically now.  Simply
draw vias for the pins, lines on the solder and/or component layers for
surface-mount pads (they must be either horizontal or vertical), and
lines and arcs on the silkscreen layer for the silkscreen outline. You
should _name_ (_N_ key) each via and copper line with the pin _number_.
Once you are happy with the geometry, select everything that is to
become part of the element, then choose `convert selection to element'
from the Select menu.  Afterwords you can make pin (or pad) one square
if you like, and give the element its various names. You can also give
the pins and pads their functional names. Note that the element mark
corresponds to the position you click after choosing the conversion
from the menu, so decide where the mark goes and make sure it falls on
a grid point before you request the conversion.  If the vias/lines are
not named, then the pin numbering will correspond to the order in which
they were placed.

   When you create a new element, remember that silkscreen lines should
_never_ overlap the copper part of the pins or pads, as this can
interfere with soldering. The silkscreen should identify the maximum
extent of the element package so it is easy to see how close elements
can be placed together.

   If you want to make an element similar to an existing one, you can
break an element into constituent pieces from the Buffer menu.  Paste
the pieces to the layout, make the necessary changes, then convert it
back into an element. If the pin numbers haven't changed, there is no
need to name each via/line as they are pre-named when the element was
broken apart. When you create a new element, you can save it to a file
in order to have easy access to it the next time you run `Pcb'.

2.4 Layers
==========

Every layout consists of several layers that can be used independently
or treated as a group.  Layer groups can be used to logically separate
(and color-code) different traces (_e.g._ power and signal); however,
all layers within a group reside on the same physical copper layer of a
board, so using different layers within the same group won't provide
electrical separation where they touch or overlap.  For details, see
`layerGroups', *note Resources::.  Each layer is drawn in a color
defined in the resource file and identified by a name that you can
change (for details see `layerColor', *note Resources::.)  Layers are
really just containers for line, arc, polygon, and text objects.  The
component and solder layers contain SMD elements as well, but the file
structure doesn't reflect that fact directly.

   Each layer group represents a physical layer on the printed circuit
board.  If you want to make a four layer board, you'll need to have at
least four layer groups.  Connections between layer groups are
established only through element pins and vias.  The relationship
between a specific layer and the board itself is configurable from the
`Edit layer groups' option in the Settings menu.  The layer groups
corresponding to the physical layers: _component-side_ and
_solder-side_ are always defined and you must map at least one logical
layer to each, even if you plan to make a single-sided board.  You are
not obligated to put tracks on either of them.  Surface mount elements
always reside on either the component-side or the solder-side layer
group. When you paste an element from the buffer, it will go onto
whichever side of the board you are viewing.  You can swap which side
of the board you are viewing by pressing the _Tab_ key, or by selecting
`view solder side' from the Screen menu.  The layer groups just have a
name or number associated with them - where they are sandwiched in the
board is left for you to tell the manufacturer.

   The silkscreen layer is special because there are actually two
silkscreen layers, one for the top (component) and one for the bottom
(solder) side of the board. Which silk layer you draw on is determined
by the side of the board that you are viewing. If you are viewing the
component side, then drawing on the silk layer draws to the
component-side silk layer.

   The netlist layer is another special layer. It shows rat's-nest lines
(_i.e._ guides that show how the netlist expects the element to
interconnect).  If you make this the active layer, you can use the Line
tool to add entries into the netlist, or to delete connections from the
netlist window. Except for these two purposes, you should not make the
netlist layer the active layer. Usually there is no need to do this
because a separate schematic package should be used to create the
netlist. `Pcb' can automatically draw all of the rats from the netlist.
In some cases you may want to make a small change without going to the
trouble of modifying the schematic, which is why this facility is
provided.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Line Objects,  Next: Arc Objects,  Prev: Layer Objects,  Up: Intro

2.5 Lines
=========

Lines are used to draw tracks on the pc board.  When in the line mode,
each _Btn1_ press establishes one end of a line.  Once the second point
is defined, the line is drawn and a new line started where the first
one ended.  You can abandon the new starting point in favor of another
by pressing _Ctrl-Btn1_, or _Btn3_, but don't use _Btn2_.  The undo
function (_U_ key or `Undo' from the Edit menu) will take you back
point by point if you use it while in the line mode.

   New lines can be restricted to 45 degree angles if desired. You can
toggle this restriction on and off while creating lines by pressing the
_period_ key.  If the 45 degree restriction is turned on, then the _/_
(forward slash) key can be used to cycle through three different modes
of 45 degree line creation.  One mode just creates a single line forced
to the nearest 45 degree vector.  The next mode creates two lines from
the start to end points such that the first line leaves the start point
at a 90 degree vector, and the second line enters the end point on a 45
degree vector. The last mode creates two lines such that the first line
leaves the start point on a 45 degree vector and arrives at the end
point on a 90 degree vector.  You can temporarily swap between the last
two modes by holding the _Shift_ key down.

   It is simple to edit a line object by breaking it into pieces
(insert point mode), moving an end point or the whole line (_Arrow
tool_), or changing the layer it resides on (_M_ key moves the line
under the pointer to the active layer).  In the case when two line
segments meet at exactly the same point you can delete the intermediate
point, otherwise the delete tool removes an entire line.  Feel free to
experiment since `Pcb' will allow you to undo and redo anything that
materially affects your work.  If you switch active layers in the midst
of placing lines a via will automatically be placed, when necessary, in
order to continue the connection.

   If you draw a line inside a polygon, it will either plow through the
polygon creating a clearance, or touch the polygon. This behavior is
selectable in the Settings menu for new lines. To change the behavior
of an existing line, hit the _J_ key with the cross hair over the line.
You can increase the size of the clearance by 2 mils on each edge with
the with the _K_ key. _Shift-K_ will decrease the clearance by 2 mils.
The increment may be changed from 2 mils through the application
resource file.  The clearance can be also increased, decreased and set
by the _ChangeClearSize_ action.

   Lines do not need to intersect the center of a pin, pad, via, or
other line for `Pcb' to understand that they make electrical connection.
If the connection is too tenuous, running the design rule checker will
report that the connection may break if the line width shrinks slightly.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Arc Objects,  Next: Polygon Objects,  Prev: Line Objects,  Up: Intro

2.6 Arcs
========

`Pcb' can handle arcs of any angular extent, but when you create an arc
with the Arc tool, it will be a quarter circle (this means they always
bend a right angle).  Arcs are very similar to lines otherwise.  They
are created on the active layer and have the same thickness that new
lines will have.  The various clicks for creating lines work pretty
much the same way for creating arcs.  In order to make the arc curve in
the desired direction, drag the mouse along the tangent line from the
starting position towards the end position. If the grid is too coarse,
it may not be possible to distinguish whether you've moved over then up,
or up then over, so if you can't seem to make the arc go in the
direction you want, try pressing the _Shift_ key while drawing the arc.
Decreasing the grid spacing may also help.  Alternatively you can draw
the wrong arc, then rotate and move it where you want. Like the Line
tool, after an arc is drawn a new starting point is established at the
end point.

   Whenever a starting point is established by either the Line or Arc
tools it will be retained if you switch directly between the tools
(e.g. _F2_ key for Lines, _F8_ key for Arcs. Arcs can either touch or
clear polygons just like lines do. Of course connection searches, undo
and all the other features you'd expect work with arcs too.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Polygon Objects,  Next: Text Objects,  Prev: Arc Objects,  Up: Intro

2.7 Polygons
============

Sometimes it's useful to fill large areas with solid copper.  The way
to do this is with polygons.  Polygons can be created in either the
polygon mode or the rectangle mode.  In the polygon mode, you'll have
to define each corner of the polygon with a mouse click (_Btn1_). When
the last point is clicked exactly on top of the starting point, the
polygon is finished.  Since this can be hard to do, the _Shift-P_ key
will enter the final point for you, closing the polygon.  If the 45
degree angle restriction is turned on and you try to close the polygon
when it is not possible, you'll get a warning instead. If you haven't
finished entering a polygon, but want to undo one (or more) of the
points that you've already defined, use the undo command (_U_ key).

   With the rectangle tool, defining the two diagonally opposite
corners is sufficient, but of course the resulting polygon is a
rectangle.  Like lines, a polygon can by edited by deleting, inserting
and moving the points that define it. Pins and vias _always_ clear
through polygons without touching them when first positioned. You must
add a thermal with the thermal tool in order to connect pins and vias
to polygons. Thermals can be added and removed by clicking _Btn1_ with
the thermal tool over the pin or via.  The thermal tool always places a
thermal to polygons on the active layer, so if the tool doesn't seem to
work, it's probably because the polygon you want to touch is not on the
active layer.  You can change the style of thermal used or make a solid
connection by holding down _Shift_ while clicking _Btn1_ with the
thermal tool over the pin or via.

   `Pcb' is capable of handling complex polygons, but using a number of
simpler ones improves performance of the connection tracing code.  You
also must be careful not to create polygons that touch or overlap
themselves.  The fabricated board may not look the way you expect if
you violate this principle. It is always ok to have two (or more)
polygons touch or overlap each other, but not for points within the
same polygon to do so.

   The great advantage to this new polygon behavior is that simple or
complex ground and/or power planes can be easily made with polygons and
seen on the screen.  If you don't want this auto-clearance behavior, or
you load a layout created by an early version of `Pcb', the old behavior
(shorts to all piercing pins and vias) is available.  A `ChangeSize'
operation (_S_ key) toggles a polygon between the new and old
polygon/pin behavior.

2.8 Text
========

Text objects should be used to label a layout or to put additional
information on the board. Elements have their `layout-name' labels on
the silk-screen layer. If you are making a board without a silkscreen,
you can use copper text to label the elements, but you have to do this
manually.

   Text is always horizontal when first created, but the rotate mode
can align it along 0, 90, 180 and 270 degree angles.  Text on the far
side of the board will automatically appear mirror-imaged.

   _Warning:_ TEXT OBJECTS ON A COPPER LAYER CREATE COPPER LINES BUT
THEY ARE NOT SCANNED FOR CONNECTIONS OR TESTED FOR CREATING SHORTS VS.
THE NETLIST. NEITHER ARE TEXT OBJECTS TESTED AGAINST ANY DESIGN RULES.

2.9 Nets
========

Layout files also contain the netlist that describes how the elements
are supposed to be interconnected. This list of connections can be
loaded from a netlist file (see *note Netlist File::), or entered by
drawing rat-lines as described previously. Each net has a name and
routing style associated with it.  The net contains a list of all
element _layout-name_ names and pin _numbers_ that should be connected
to the net. Loading a netlist file will replace all existing nets with
the ones from the file.  The _Netlist_ window provides an easy way to
browse through the net list. You can display the rat's-nest by selecting
`optimize rats-nest' from the Connects menu. If you move or rotate
elements, the rat's-nest will automatically follow the movements, but
they won't necessarily show the shortest paths until you optimize them
again.

3 Getting Started
*****************

The goal of this chapter is to give you enough information to learn how
`Pcb' works and how to develop your layouts to make the best use of
`Pcb''s features. All event translations (_i.e._ the buttons and keys
you press) refer to the default application resource file shipped with
`Pcb'.  There is probably no need to change this unless your window
manager uses some of the button events itself; however, if you _want_
to customize the behavior of `Pcb' then changing the resource file is
usually the best way to do it.

   Get yourself a printout of this chapter and _User Commands_, if you
haven't already done so, and follow the examples.

   Start `Pcb' (the actual command will use all lower-case letters)
without any additional options.  If you get the error message:

         can't find default font-symbol-file 'default_font'
   then the font searchpath or filename in the application resource
file is wrong. Be sure that your `m4' program supports search paths.
If not, get `GNU m4'.  For other messages, see *note problems::.
Another quick-start is provided by `pcbtest.sh' in the `src' directory.
If some features don't seem to work, try running `pcbtest.sh', if that
works, then `Pcb' hasn't been installed properly.

3.1 The Application Window
==========================

The main window consists of five areas: the menu at the top, the layer
control in the upper left, the tool buttons located below the layer
controls, the Layout area to the right of these, and the status line at
the bottom of the window.

* Menu:

* Menu::
* Status-line and Input-field::  What is the program configuration.
* Layer Controls::               Switch layers on/off; change current one.
* Tool Selectors::               Select a layout tool.
* Layout Area::		         Where the layout is drawn.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Menu,  Next: Status-line and Input-field,  Up: Application Window

3.1.1 Menus
-----------

The menus are located at the top of the Layout area. Most, but not all,
of their functions are also available from the keyboard. Similarly, some
functions are only achievable through the keyboard or command entry.
Some menu entries such as `center layout' in the Screen menu require a
certain cross hair position.  In this case a prompt message will popup
at the bottom of the screen with wording similar to the following:
     move pointer to the appropriate screen position and press a button
   Any mouse button will do the job, whereas any key except the arrow
(cursor) keys will cancel the operation. If it seems like the menu
hasn't done what you expected, check to see if it is waiting for the
position click. For details see *note Actions::.

   Pressing _Btn3_ in the Layout area also pops up a menu with many of
the most common operations (except when you're in the midst of drawing
a line or arc). When a choice in the _Btn3_ popup menu needs a cross
hair position, it uses the position where the cross hair was when
_Btn3_ was pressed. For example, to get detailed information on an
object, place the cross hair over the object, press _Btn3_, then choose
`object report'.  If you pop up the _Btn3_ menu but don't want to take
any of the actions, click on one of the headers in the menu.

File
     This menu offers a choice of loading, saving and printing data,
     saving connection information to a file or quitting the
     application. Most of the entries in the File menu are self
     explanatory.  Selecting `Print...' pops up a printer control
     dialog.  Several output formats are available from the `Export...'
     menu item.  Presently _PostScript_, _encapsulated PostScript_, and
     _GerberX_ are some of the supported filetypes.  The _GerberX_
     driver produces all of the files necessary to have the board
     professionally manufactured.  The connection saving features in
     the File menu produce outputs in an arcane format that is not too
     useful. They do _not_ produce netlist files.

Edit
     The Edit menu provides the usual cut, copy, paste which work on
     selections. To learn how to create complex selections, see *note
     Arrow Tool::.  The Edit menu also provides access to Undo and Redo
     of the last operation. These can also be accomplished with the _U_
     key and _Shift-R_ key.  Finally, the Edit menu allows you to
     change the names of: the layout, the active layer, or text objects
     on the layout.

Routes Style
     The Edit menu allows you to select a group of line thickness, via
     diameter, via drill size, and clearance (keepaway) (collectively
     called a "routing style") to be copied to the "active" sizes.  You
     can also change the names given to the routing styles and adjust
     their values from this menu.  The "active" sizes are also
     adjustable from this menu.  The "active" sizes are shown in the
     status-line and control the initial size of new vias, drilling
     holes, lines, clearances, text-objects and also the maximum
     dimensions of the board layout.

View
     The View menu supports most functions related to the whole Layout
     area. There are various entries to change the grid to some popular
     values, the zoom factor, and which kind of element name is
     displayed.  You can also re-align the grid origin and turn on and
     off the display of the grid.  Before changing the grid alignment,
     I recommend that you zoom in as close as possible so that you're
     sure the grid points appear exactly where you want them.

     The View menu also allows you to turn on and off the visibility of
     the solder-mask layer. When the solder-mask layer is made visible
     it obscures most of the layout, so only turn this on when you
     really want to know what the solder-mask will look like. The
     solder-mask that you see belongs to the side of the board you are
     viewing, which can be changed with the `Flip up/down' option, also
     found in the View menu.  When the solder-mask is displayed, the
     pin and pad clearance adjustments (*note Line Objects::) alter the
     size of mask cut-outs.

Settings
     The Settings menu controls several operating configuration
     parameters. The `all-direction lines' entry controls the clipping
     of lines to 45-degree angles. You can also control whether moving
     individual objects causes the attached lines to "rubber band" with
     the move or not from the Settings menu. Another entry controls
     whether the starting clip angle for the two-line mode (*note Line
     Objects::) alternates every other line. You can also control
     whether element names must be unique from the Settings menu.  When
     unique element names are enforced, copying a new element will
     automatically create a unique `layout-name' name for it provided
     that the name originally ended with a digit (_e.g._ U7 or R6). The
     Settings menu allows you to control whether the cross hair will
     snap to pins and pads even when they are off-grid. Finally you can
     control whether new lines and arcs touch or clear intersecting
     polygons from this menu.

Select
     This menu covers most of the operations that work with selected
     objects.  You may either (un)select all visible objects on a
     layout or only the ones which have been found by the last
     connection scan see .  You can delete all selected objects from
     this menu.  Other entries in the Select menu change the sizes of
     selected objects.  Note that a select action only affects those
     objects that are selected _and_ have their visibility turned on in
     the Layer Control panel. The Select menu also provides a means for
     selecting objects by name using unix *note Regular Expressions::.

Buffer
     From the Buffer menu you may select one out of five buffers to
     use, rotate or clear its contents or save the buffer contents to a
     file. You can also use the `break buffer elements to pieces' entry
     to de-compose an element into pieces for editing.  Note: only
     objects with visibility turned on are pasted to the layout. If you
     have something in a buffer, then change which side of the board you
     are viewing, the contents of the buffer will automatically be
     mirrored for pasting on the side you are viewing. It is not
     necessary to clear a buffer before cutting or copying something
     into it - it will automatically be cleared first.

Connects
     The entries available through the Connects menu allow you to find
     connections from objects and to manipulate these.  You can also
     optimize or erase rat's nests from this menu. Finally, the
     `auto-route all rats' entry allows you to auto-route all
     connections show by the rat's nest. The auto-router will use any
     visible copper layer for routing, so turn off the visibility of any
     layers you don't want it to use. The auto-router will automatically
     understand and avoid any traces that are already on the board, but
     it is not restricted to the grid. Finally, the auto-router routes
     using the active sizes (except for nets that have a route-style
     defined). `Pcb' always knows which tracks were routed by the
     auto-router, and you can selectively remove them without fear of
     changing tracks that you have manually routed with the `rip-up all
     auto-routed tracks' entry in the Connects menu.  The `design rule
     checker' entry runs a check for copper areas that are too close
     together, or connections that touch too tenuously for reliable
     production. The DRC stops when the first problem is encountered so
     after fixing a problem be sure to run it again until no problems
     are found.
          _Warning:_ COPPER TEXT IS IGNORED BY THE DRC CHECKER.

Info
     The `generate object report' entry from the Info menu provides a
     way to get detailed information about an object, such as its
     coordinates, dimensions, etc.  You can also get a report
     summarizing all of the drills used on the board with `generate
     drill summary'. Lastly, you can get a list of all pins, pads and
     vias that were found during a connection search.

Window
     The Window menu provides a way to bring each of `Pcb's' windows to
     the front. The _Library_ window is used to bring elements from the
     library into the paste-buffer. The _Message Log_ window holds the
     various messages that `Pcb' sends to the user. The _Netlist_
     window shows the list of connections desired.


   Now that you're familiar with the various menus, it's time to try
some things out. From the File menu choose `Open...', navigate to the
tutorial folder, then load the file `tut1.pcb'.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Status-line and Input-field,  Next: Layer Controls,  Prev: Menu,  Up: Application Window

3.1.2 The Status-line and Input-field
-------------------------------------

The status-line is located at the bottom edge of the main window.
During normal operation the status information is visible there.  When
a selected menu operation requires an additional button click, the
status-line is replaced by a message telling you to position the cursor
and click.  When a text input is required, the status-line is replaced
by the Input-field which has a prompt for typing the input.

   The status-line shows, from left to right, the side of the board
that you are viewing (_Tab_ key changes this), the current grid values,
if new lines are restricted to 45 degrees, which type of 45 degree line
mode is active, whether rubberband move and rotate mode is on (R), and
the zoom factor.  This information is followed by the active
line-width, via-size and drilling hole, keepaway spacing, and text
scaling. Last is the active buffer number and the name of the layout.
An asterisk appearing at the far left indicates that the layout has
been modified since the last save.  Note that the name of the layout is
not the same thing as the filename of the layout.  Change the grid
factor to 1.0 mm from the Screen menu. Observe how the status line
shows the new grid setting. Except for the case of the metric grid, all
dimensions in the status line are in units of 0.001 inch (1 mil).

   The input-field pops up (temporarily replacing the status-line)
whenever user input is required. Two keys are bound to the input field:
the _Escape_ key aborts the input, _Return_ accepts it. Let's change
the name of a component on the board to see how the input-field works.
Position the cross hair over R5, and press the _N_ key. The input field
pops-up showing the name for you to edit. Go ahead and change the name,
then hit return. Notice the name of the element changed. Now undo the
change by pressing the _U_ key. You can position the cross hair over
the name, or the element before pressing the _N_ key.

   Now select `realign grid' from the Screen menu. Notice that the
status line has been replaced with an instruction to position the cursor
where you want a grid point to fall. In this case, since the cross hair
can only fall on a grid point, you must move the tip of the finger
cursor to the place where you want a grid point to appear. Do not worry
that the cross hair is not coincident with the cursor. Click _Btn1_ at
your chosen location. See how the grid has shifted, and the status line
has returned.

   The present cross hair position is displayed in the upper right
corner of the window.  Normally this position is an absolute
coordinate, but you can anchor a marker at the cross hair location by
pressing _Ctrl-M_ (try it now) and then the display will read both the
absolute cross hair position as well as the difference between it and
the marker. The numbers enclosed in < > are the X and Y distances
between the cross hair and the mark, while the numbers enclosed in
parenthesis are the distance and angle from the mark to the cross hair.
The values displayed are always in units of 0.001 inch (1 mil).
Pressing _Ctrl-M_ again turns the marker off.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Layer Controls,  Next: Tool Selectors,  Prev: Status-line and Input-field,  Up: Application Window

3.1.3 The Layer Controls
------------------------

The layer control panel, located in the upper left, is used to turn on
and off the display of layer groups and to select the active drawing
layer.  If a layer hasn't been named, the label "_(unknown)_" is used
as the default.  If this happens, it probably means the application
resources are not installed properly.

   The upper buttons are used to switch layers on and off. Click
_<Btn1>_ on one or more of them. Each click toggles the setting.  If
you turn off the currently active layer, another one that is visible
will become active. If there are no others visible, you will not be
able to turn off the active layer.  When the layers are grouped,
clicking on these buttons will toggle the visibility of all layers in
the same group. This is a good idea because layers in the same group
reside on the same physical layer of the actual board. Notice that this
example has 2 groups each having 3 layers, plus two other layers named
`unused'.  Use the `Edit layer groups' option in the `Settings' menu to
change the layer groupings in the lesstif GUI or the `Preferences'
dialog from the `File' menu in the GTK+ GUI. Note that changing the
groupings can radically alter the connectivity on the board.  Grouping
layers is only useful for helping you to color-code signals in your
layout. Note that grouping layers actually reduces the number of
different physical layers available for your board, so to make an eight
layer board, you cannot group any layers.

   The _far side_ button turns on and off the visibility of elements
(including SMD pads) on the opposite (to the side you're viewing) board
side, as well as silk screening on that side. It does not hide the
x-ray view of the other copper layers, these must be turned off
separately if desired.  Use the _tab_ key to view the entire board from
the other side.  To see a view of what the back side of the board will
actually look like, make the solder layer the active layer then press
_tab_ until the status line says "solder" on the right, then turn off
the visibility of all layers except solder, pins/pads, vias, and silk.
Now turn them all back on.

   The lowest button, named _active_, is used to change the active
drawing layer. Pressing _<Btn1>_ on it pops up a menu to select which
layer should be active.  Each entry is labeled with the layer's name
and drawn in its color.  The active layer is automatically made
visible. The active layer is always drawn on top of the other layers,
so the ordering of layers on the screen does not generally reflect the
ordering of the manufactured board. Only the solder, component,
silkscreen, and solder-mask layers are always drawn in their physical
order. Bringing the active layer to the top makes it easier to select
and change objects on the active layer.  Try changing the active
layer's name to _ABC_ by selecting `edit name of active layer' from the
`Edit' menu.  Changing the active layer can also be done by pressing
keys _1..MAX_LAYER_.

   Turn off the visibility of the component layer.  Now make the
component layer the active layer. Notice that it automatically became
visible. Try setting a few other layers as the active layer. You should
also experiment with turning on and off each of the layers to see what
happens.

   The netlist layer is a special layer for adding connections to the
netlist by drawing rat lines. This is not the recommended way to add to
the netlist, but occasionally may be convenient.  To learn how to use
the netlist layer see *note Net Objects::.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Tool Selectors,  Next: Layout Area,  Prev: Layer Controls,  Up: Application Window

3.1.4 The Tool Selectors
------------------------

The tool selector buttons reside below the layer controls.  They are
used to select which layout tool to use in the drawing area. Each tool
performs its function when _Btn1_ is pressed.  Every tool gives the
cursor a unique shape that identifies it.  The tool selector buttons
themselves are icons that illustrate their function.  Each layout tool
can also be selected from the keyboard:
         _F1_ key       Via tool
         _F2_ key       Line tool
         _F3_ key       Arc tool
         _F4_ key       Text tool
         _F5_ key       Rectangle tool
         _F6_ key       Polygon tool
         _F7_ key       Buffer tool
         _F8_ key       Delete tool
         _F9_ key       Rotate tool
         _Insert_ key   Insert-point tool
         _F10_ key      Thermal tool
         _F11_ key      Arrow tool
         _F12_ key      Lock tool

   Some of the tools are very simple, such as the Via tool.  Clicking
_Btn1_ with the Via tool creates a via at the cross hair position.  The
via will have the diameter and drill sizes that are active, as shown in
the status line.  The Buffer tool is similar.  With it, _<Btn1>_ copies
the contents of the active buffer to the layout, but only those parts
that reside on visible layers are copied.  The Rotate tool allows you
to rotate elements, arcs, and text objects 90 degrees counter-clockwise
with each click. Holding the _Shift_ key down changes the Rotate tool
to clockwise operation.  Anything including groups of objects can be
rotated inside a buffer using the rotate buffer menu option.

   The Line tool is explained in detail in *note Line Objects::. Go read
that section if you haven't already.  Activate the Line tool. Set the
active layer to the solder layer.  Try drawing some lines. Use the _U_
key to undo some of the lines you just created. Zoom in a bit closer
with the _Z_ key.  Draw some more lines. Be sure to draw some separate
lines by starting a new anchor point with _Ctrl-Btn1_. Change the
`crosshair snaps to pin/pads' behavior in the Settings menu. Now draw a
line. Notice that the new line points must now always be on a grid
point. It might not be able to reach some pins or pads with this
setting. Increase the active line thickness by pressing the _L_ key.
Note that the status line updates to reflect the new active line
thickness. Now draw another line. Before completing the next line, make
the component layer active by pressing the _4_ key.  Now finish the
line. Notice that a via was automatically placed where you switched
layers. `Pcb' does not do any checks to make sure that the via could
safely be placed there. Neither does it interfere with your desire to
place lines haphazardly. It is up to you to place things properly when
doing manual routing with the Line tool.

   The Arc tool is explained in detail in *note Arc Objects::. Its use
is very similar to the Line tool.

   The Rectangle tool, Polygon tool and Thermal tool are explained in
detail in *note Polygon Objects::. Go read that section.  Remember that
the Thermal tool will only create and destroy thermals to polygons on
the active layer. Use the Rectangle tool to make a small copper plane
on the component layer. Now place a via in the middle of the plane.
Notice that it does not touch the plane, and they are not electrically
connected. Use the Thermal tool to make the via connect to the plane.
Thermals allow the via or pin to be heated by a soldering iron without
having to heat the entire plane. If solid connections were made to the
plane, it could be nearly impossible to solder. Shift-click on the via
with the Thermal tool to change the style of thermal used or to make
the connection solid.  Click on the via again with the Thermal tool to
remove the connection to the plane.

   The Insert-point tool is an editing tool that allows you to add
points into lines and polygons.  The Insert-point tool enforces the 45
degree line rule.  You can force only the shorter line segment to 45
degrees by holding the _Shift_ key down while inserting the point.  Try
adding a point into one of the lines you created. Since line clipping
is turned on, you may need to move the cross hair quite far from the
point where you first clicked on the line. Turn off the line clipping
by selecting `all-direction lines' from the Settings menu (or hit the
_Period_ key). Now you can place an inserted point anywhere.  Try
adding a point to the rectangle you made earlier. Start by clicking
somewhere along an edge of the rectangle, then move the pointer to a
new location and click again.

   The delete-mode deletes the object beneath the cursor with each
_Btn1_ click.  If you click at an end-point that two lines have in
common, it will replace the two lines with a single line spanning the
two remaining points.  This can be used to delete an "inserted" point
in a line, restoring the previous line.  Now delete one of the original
corner points of the polygon you were just playing with. To do this,
place the cross hair over the corner and click on it with the Delete
tool. You could also use the _Backspace_ key if some other tool is
active. Try deleting some of the lines and intermediate points that you
created earlier. Use undo repeatedly to undo all the changes that
you've made. Use redo a few times to see what happens. Now add a new
line. Notice that you can no longer use redo since the layout has
changed since the last undo happened. The undo/redo tree is always
pruned in this way (_i.e._ it has a root, but no branches).

   The Arrow tool is so important, it has its own section: *note Arrow
Tool::.  Go read it now.

   The Lock tool allows you to lock objects on the layout. When an
object is locked, it can't be selected, moved, rotated, or resized.
This is useful for very large objects like ground planes, or
board-outlines that are defined as an element. With such large objects,
nearly anywhere you click with the Arrow tool will be on the large
object, so it could be hard to draw box selections. If you lock an
object, the Arrow tool will behave as if it didn't exist.  You cannot
unlock an object with undo.  You must click on it again with the Lock
tool. If an object is locked, previous changes to it cannot be undone
either. When you lock an object, a report message about it is popped up
and will always tell you what object it is, and that it is locked if
you just locked it.  Other than noticing your inability to manipulate
something, the only way to tell an object is locked is with a report
from the Info menu. Use the Lock tool sparingly.

3.1.5 Layout Area
-----------------

The layout area is where you see the layout. The cursor shape depends
on the active tool when the pointer is moved into the layout area.  A
cross hair follows the mouse pointer with respect to the grid setting.
Select a new grid from the _Screen_ menu.  The new value is updated in
the status line.  A different way to change the grid is _Shift<Key>g_
to decrease or _<Key>g_ to increase it, but this only works for English
(integer mil) grids.  The grid setting is saved along with the data
when you save a pcb layout.  For homemade layouts a value around 50 is
a good setting.  The cursor can also be moved in the layout area with
the cursor (arrow) keys or, for larger distances, by pressing the
_Shift_ modifier together with a cursor key.

3.2 Log Window
==============

This optional window is used to display all kind of messages including
the ones written to _stderr_ by external commands. The main advantage
of using it is that its contents are saved in a scrolling list until the
program exits. Disabling this feature by setting the resource
_useLogWindow_ to _false_ will generate popup windows to display
messages. The _stderr_ of external commands will appear on `Pcb's
_stderr_ which normally is the parent shell. I suggest you iconify the
log window after startup for example by setting _*log.iconic_ to _true_
in the resource file. If _raiseLogWindow_ is set _true_, the window
will deiconify and raise itself whenever new messages are to be
displayed.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Library Window,  Next: Netlist Window,  Prev: Log Window,  Up: Getting Started

3.3 Library Window
==================

The library window makes loading elements (or even partial layouts)
easy.  Just click the appropriate library from the list on the left. A
list of its elements then appears on the right. Select an element from
the list by clicking on its description. Selecting an element from the
library will also automatically copy the element into the active
buffer, then invoke the _Buffer_ tool so you can paste it to the
layout. Elements in the old library should be taken with a grain of
salt (_i.e._ check them carefully before using).  The old library names
all begin with ~ so you can easily distinguish between the old and new
libraries.  All of the elements in the new library should  be
thoroughly vetted, so you can use them with confidence. The new
libraries are stored simply as directories full of element files, so
making additions to the new library is easy since there is no need to

3.4 Netlist Window
==================

The netlist window is very similar to the library window. On the left
is a list of all of the nets, on the right is the list of connections
belonging to the chosen net. The chosen net is highlighted in the list
and also shown on the second line of the window in red. If the net name
has a star to the left of it then it is "disabled". A disabled net is
treated as if it were not in the net list. This is useful, for example,
if you plan to use a ground plane and don't want the ground net showing
up in the rat's nest. You can enable/disable individual nets by
double-clicking the net name. If you want to enable or disable all nets
at once, there are two buttons at the top of the netlist window for
this purpose.

   The button labeled `Sel Net On Layout' can be used to select (on the
layout) everything that is connected (or is supposed to be connected)
to the net. If you click on a connection in the connection list, it
will select/deselect the corresponding pin or pad in the layout and
also center the layout window where it is located. If you "Find"
(`lookup connection' in the Connects menu [also _F_ key]), a pin or pad
it will also choose the net and connection in the netlist window if it
exists in the netlist.

   If no netlist exists for the layout, then the netlist window does not
appear. You can load a netlist from a file from the File menu. The
format for netlist files is described in *note Netlist File::.

3.5 Drawing and Removing Basic Objects
======================================

hace begging gutting here, and do a real-world tutorial example.

   There are several ways of creating new objects: you can draw them
yourself, you can copy an existing object (or selection), or you can
load an element from a file or from the Library window. Each type of
object has a particular tool for creating it.

   The active tool can be selected from the tool selectors in the bottom
left corner or by one of the function keys listed earlier in this
chapter.  Each _<Btn1>_ press with the tool tells the application to
create or change the appropriate object or at least take the first step
to do so. Each tools causes the cursor to take on a unique shape and
also causes the corresponding tool selector button to be highlighted.
You can use either cue to see which tool is active.

   Insert mode provides the capability of inserting new points into
existing polygons or lines. The 45 degree line clipping is now enforced
when selected.  Press and hold the shift key while positioning the new
point to only clip the line segment to the nearer of the two existing
points to 45 degrees.  You can also toggle the 45-degree clipping in
the middle of a point insertion by pressing the _<Key>._ If the shift
key is not depressed and the 45 degree line clipping mode is on, both
new line segments must be on 45 degree angles - greatly restricting
where the new point may be placed. In some cases this can cause
confusion as to whether an insertion has been started since the two new
lines may be forced to lie parallel on top of the original line until
the pointer is moved far from the end points.

   Removing objects, changing their size or moving them only applies to
objects that are visible when the command is executed.

3.5.1 Common Drawing and Removing Methods
-----------------------------------------

There are several keystrokes and button events referring to an _object_
without identifying its type. Here's a list of them:

   _<Btn1>_ creates (or deletes)  an object depending on the current
mode.

   _<Key>BackSpace_ or _<Key>Delete_ removes the visible object at the
cursor location. When more than one object exists at the location, the
order of removal is: via, line, text, polygon and element. The drawn
layer order also affects the search - whatever is top - most (except
elements) is affected before lower items.  Basically all this means
that what is removed is probably just what you expect.  If for some
reason it isn't, undo and try again.  Only one object is removed for
each keystroke. If two or more of the same type match, the newest one
is removed.

   Use _<Key>s_ and _Shift<Key>s_ to change the size (width) of lines,
arcs, text objects, pins, pads and vias, or to toggle the style of
polygons (whether pins and vias automatically have clearances).

   _<Key>n_ changes the name of pins, pads, vias, the string of a text
object, or the currently displayed label of an element.

   _<Key>m_ moves the line, arc, or polygon under the cross hair to the
active layer if it wasn't on that layer already.

   _<Key>u_ (undo) recovers from an unlimited number of operations such
as creating, removing, moving, copying, selecting etc. It works like
you'd expect even if you're in the midst of creating something.

   _Shift<Key>r_ restores the last undone operation provided no other
changes have been made since the undo was performed.

   _<Key>tab_ changes the board side you are viewing.

   For a complete list of keystrokes and button events see *note
Translations::.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Lines,  Next: Arcs,  Prev: Common,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.2 Lines
-----------

To draw new lines you have to be in _line-mode_. Get there either by
selecting it from the _Tool palette_ or by pressing _<Key>F2_.  Each
successive _notify_ event creates a new line. The adjustment to 45
degree lines is done automatically if it is selected from the _Display_
menu. You can toggle the 45 degree mode setting by pressing the
_<Key>._ (That is the period key). When 45 degree enforcement is turned
on there are three distinct modes of line creation: a single line on
the closest 45 degree vector towards the cross hair (but not necessarily
actually ending at the cross hair), two lines created such that the
first leaves the start point on a 90 degree vector and the second
arrives at the cross hair on a 45 degree vector, and finally two lines
created such that the first leaves the start point on a 45 degree
vector and the second arrives at the cross hair on a 90 degree vector.
These last two modes always connect all the way from the start and end
points, and all lines have angles in 45 degree multiples.  The _<Key>/_
cycles through the three modes.  The status line shows a text icon to
indicate which of the modes is active and the lines following the cross
hair motion show the outline of the line(s) that will actually be
created.  Press _<Key>Escape_ to leave line-mode.

   _<Key>l_, _Shift<Key>l_ and the entries in the _Sizes_ menu change
the initial width of new lines.  This width is also displayed in the
status line.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Arcs,  Next: Polygons,  Prev: Lines,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.3 Arcs
----------

An Arc is drawn  with the _arc-tool_. Get there either by selecting it
from the _Tool palette_ or by pressing _<Key>F8_. Press _Btn1_ to
define the starting point for the arc.  Drag the mouse towards the
desired end point along the path you want the arc to follow.  The
outline of the arc that will be created is shown on the screen as you
move the mouse.  Arcs are always forced to be 90 degrees and have
symmetrical length and width ( i.e. they are a quarter circle).  The
next _Btn1_ click creates the arc.  It will have the same width as new
lines (displayed in the status line) and appear on the active layer.
The arc leaves the starting point towards the cross hair along the axis
whose distance from the cross hair is largest.  Normally this means that
if you drag along the path you want the arc to follow, you'll get what
you want.  If the grid is set to the arc radius, then the two distances
will be equal and you won't be able to get all of the possible
directions.  If this is thwarting your desires, reduce the grid spacing
(_!Shift<Key>G_) and try again.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Polygons,  Next: Text,  Prev: Arcs,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.4 Polygons and Rectangles
-----------------------------

A polygon is drawn by defining all of its segments as a series of
consecutive line segments. If the first point matches a new one and if
the number of points is greater than two, then the polygon is closed.
Since matching up with the first point may be difficult, you may use
_Shift<Key>p_ to close the polygon. The _Shift<Key>p_ won't work if
clipping to 45 degree lines is selected and the final segment cannot
match this condition.  I suggest you create simple convex polygons in
order to avoid a strong negative impact on the performance of the
connection scanning routines.  The _rectangle-mode_ is just an easy way
to generate rectangular polygons.  _Polygon-mode_ also is selected by
_<Key>F6_ whereas _rectangle-mode_ uses _<Key>F4_.  Pressing a _<Btn1>_
at two locations creates a rectangle by defining two of its corners.
_<Key>Insert_ brings you to _insert-point-mode_ which lets you add
additional points to an already existing polygon.  Single points may be
removed by moving the cross hair to them and selecting one of the
delete actions _(remove-mode, BackSpace, or Delete_. This only works if
the remaining polygon will still have three or more corners.  Pressing
_<Key>u_  or _<Key>p_ while entering a new polygon brings you back to
the previous corner. Removing a point does not force clipping to 45
degree angles (because it's not generally possible).  Newly created
polygons will not connect to pins or vias that pierce it unless you
create a thermal (using the thermal mode) to make the connection. If
the edge of a polygon gets too close to a pin or via that lies outside
of it, a warning will be issued and the pin will be given a special
color. Increasing the distance between them will remove the warning
color.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Text,  Next: Vias,  Prev: Polygons,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.5 Text
----------

Pressing _<Key>F5_ or clicking one of the text selector buttons changes
to _text-mode_.  Each successive notify event (_<Btn1>_) pops up the
input line at the bottom and queries for a string.  Enter it and press
_<Key>Return_ to confirm or _<Key>Escape_ to abort.  The text object is
created with its upper left corner at the current pointer location.
The initial scaling is changed by _<Key>t_ and _Shift<Key>t_ or from
the _Sizes_ menu.

   Now switch to _rotate-mode_ and press _<Btn1>_ at the text-objects
location. Text objects on the solder side of the layout are
automatically mirrored and flipped so that they are seen correctly when
viewing the solder-side.

   Use _<Key>n_ to edit the string.

   TEXT OBJECTS ON COPPER LAYERS CREATE COPPER LINES BUT THEY ARE NOT
SCANNED FOR CONNECTIONS. If they are moved to the silkscreen layer, they
no longer create copper.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Vias,  Next: Elements,  Prev: Text,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.6 Vias
----------

The initial size of new vias may be changed by _<Key>v_ and
_Shift<Key>v_ or by selecting the appropriate entry from the _Sizes_
menu. _Mod1<Key>v_ and _Mod1 Shift<Key>v_ do the same for the drilling
hole of the via.  The statusline is updated with the new values.
Creating a via is similar to the other objects. Switch to _via-mode_ by
using either the selector button or _<Key>F1_ then press _<Key>]_ or
_<Btn1>_ to create one.  _<Key>n_ changes the name of a via. If you
want to create a mounting hole for your board, then you can place a via
where you want the hole to be then convert the via into a hole.  The
conversion is done by pressing _!Ctrl<Key>h_ with the cross hair over
the via.  Conceptually it is still a via, but it has no copper annulus.
If you create such a hole in the middle of two polygons on different
layers, it will short the layers.  Theoretically you could arrange for
such a hole not to be plated, but a metal screw inserted in the hole
would still risk shorting the layers.  A good rule is to realize that
holes in the board really are vias between the layers and so place them
where they won't interfere with connectivity.  You can convert a hole
back into a normal via with the same keystroke used to convert it in
the first place.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Elements,  Next: Pastebuffer,  Prev: Vias,  Up: Drawing and Removing

3.5.7 Elements
--------------

Some of the functions related to elements only work if both the package
layer and the pin layer are switched on.

   Now that you're familiar with many of the basic commands, it is time
to put the first element on the layout.  First of all, you have to load
data into the paste buffer.  There are four ways to do this:
        1) load the data from a library
        2) load the data from a file
        3) copy data from an already existing element
        4) convert objects in the buffer into an element
   We don't have any elements on the screen yet nor anything in the
buffer, so we use number one.

   Select _lsi_ from the menu in the library window press _<Btn1>_
twice at the appropriate text-line to get the MC68030 CPU.  The data is
loaded and the mode is switched to _pastebuffer-mode_.  Each notify
event now creates one of these beasts. Leave the mode by selecting a
different one or by _<Key>Escape_ which resets all modes..  The cross
hair is located at the _mark_ position as defined by the data file.
Rotating the buffer contents is done by selecting the _rotate_ entry of
the _Buffer_ menu or by pressing _Shift<Key>F3_. The contents of the
buffer are valid until new data is loaded into it either by a
cut-to-buffer operation, copy-to-buffer operation or by loading a new
data file.  There are 5 buffers available  (possibly more or less if
changed at compile time with the `MAX_BUFFER' variable in
`globalconfig.h').  Switching between them is done by selecting a menu
entry or by _Shift<Key>1..MAX_BUFFER_.  Each of the two board sides has
its own buffers.

   The release includes all data files for the circuits that are used
by the demo layout. The elements in the LED example are not found in
the library, but you can lift them from the example itself if you want.
If you have problems with the color of the cross hair, change the
resource _cross hairColor_ setting to a different one.

   Now load a second circuit, the MC68882 FPU for example.  Create the
circuit as explained above. You now have two different unnamed
elements. Unnamed means that the layout-name of the element hasn't been
set yet. Selecting _description_ from the _Display_ menu displays the
description string of the two circuits which are CPU and FPU. The
values of the circuits are set to MC68030 and MC68882.  Each of the
names of an element may be changed by _<Key>n_ at the elements location
and editing the old name in the bottom input line. Naming pins and vias
is similar to elements.  You can hide the element name so that it won't
appear on the board silkscreen by pressing _<key>h_ with the cursor
over the element.  Doing so again un-hides the element name.

   Entering `:le' and selecting an element data file is the second way
to load circuits.

   The third way to create a new element is to copy an existing one.
Please refer to *note Moving and Copying::.

   The fourth way to create a new element is to convert a buffer's
contents into an element.  Here's how it's done: Select the Via-tool
from the _Tool pallet_.  Set the grid spacing to something appropriate
for the element pin spacing.  Now create a series of vias where the pins
go.  Create them in pin number order. It is often handy to place a
reference point (_!Ctrl<Key>m_) in the center of the first pin in order
to measure the location of the other pins.  Next make a solder-side
layer the active layer from the _active-layer_ popup menu.  Now draw
the outline of the element using lines and arcs.  When you're done,
select everything that makes up the element with a box selection
(_<Btn3Down> drag, <Btn3Up>_). Now select "cut to buffer" from the
_Buffer_ menu. Position the cursor over the center of pin 1 and press
the left button to load the data into the buffer.  Finally select
"convert buffer to element" from the _Buffer_ menu.  You'll only want
to create elements this way if they aren't already in the library.
It's also probably a good idea to do this before starting any of the
other aspects of a layout, but it isn't necessary.

   To display the pinout of a circuit move to it and press _Shift<Key>d_
or select _show pinout_ from the _Objects_ menu. A new window pops up
and displays the complete pinout of the element. This display can be
difficult to read if the component has been rotated 90 degrees :-(
therefore, the new window will show an un-rotated view so the pin names
are readable.  _<Key>d_ displays the name of one or all pins/pads
inside the Layout area, this is only for display on-screen, it has no
effect on any printing of the layout.

   You also may want to change a pin's or pad's current size by pressing
_<Key>s_ to increase or _Shift<Key>s_ to decrease it. While this is
possible, it is not recommended since care was probably taken to define
the element structure in the first place. You can also change the
thickness of the element's silkscreen outline with the same keys. You
can change whether a pin or SMD pad is rounded or square with the
_<Key>q_.  SMD pads should usually have squared ends. Finally, you can
change whether the non-square pins are round or octagonal with the
_!Ctrl<Key>o_.

   SMD elements and silkscreen objects are drawn in the "invisible
object" color if they are located on the opposite side of the board.

   For information on element connections refer to *note Connection
Lists::.

3.5.8 Pastebuffer
-----------------

The line-stack and element-buffer of former releases have been replaced
by 5 (possibly more or less if changed at compile time with the
`MAX_BUFFER' variable in `globalconfig.h') multi-purpose buffers that
are selected by _Shift<Key>1..MAX_BUFFER_. The status line shows which
buffer is the active one.  You may load data from a file or layout into
them.  Cut-and-paste works too.  If you followed the instructions
earlier in this chapter you should now have several objects on the
screen. Move the cross hair to one of them and press _<Btn3Down>_ to
toggle its selection flag. (If you drag the mouse while the button is
down, a box selection will be attempted instead of toggling the
selection.)  The object is redrawn in a different color. You also may
want to try moving the pointer while holding the third button down and
release it on a different location. This selects all objects inside the
rectangle and unselects everything else.  If you want to add a box
selection to an existing selection, drag with _Mod1<Btn3Down>_ instead.
Dragging _Shift Mod1<Btn3Down>_ unselects objects in a box.  Now change
to _pastebuffer-mode_ and select some operations from the _Buffer_
menu. Copying objects to the buffer is available as _Mod1<Key>c_ while
cutting them uses _Mod1<Key>x_ as shortcut. Both clear the buffer
before new data is added.  If you use the menu entries, you have to
supply a cross hair position by pressing a mouse button. The objects
are attached to the pastebuffer relative to that cross hair location.
Element data or PCB data may be merged into an existing layout by
loading the datafiles into the pastebuffer. Both operations are
available from the _File_ menu or as user commands.

3.6 Moving and Copying
======================

All objects can be moved including element-names, by _<Btn2Down>_,
dragging the pointer while holding the button down and releasing it at
the new location of the object. If you use _Mod1<Btn2Down>_ instead,
the object is copied. Copying does not work for element-names of
course. You can move all selected objects with _Shift <Btn1>_.  This
uses the Pastebuffer, so it will remove whatever was previously in the
Pastebuffer.  Please refer to *note Pastebuffer::.  If you want to give
a small nudge to an object, but you don't think that the mouse will
give you the fine level of control that you want, you can position the
cursor over the object, press _<Key>[_, move it with the arrow keys,
then press _<Key>]_ when it's at the desired position.  Remember that
all movements are forced onto grid coordinates, so you may want to
change the grid spacing first.

   To move a trace or group of traces to a different layer, first select
the tracks to be moved.  It's easiest to do this if you shut off
everything but that layer first (i.e. silk, pins, other layers, etc).
Now set the current layer to be the new layer.  Press Shift-M to move
all the selected tracks to the current layer.  See the
_MoveToCurrentLayer_ action for more details.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Loading and Saving,  Next: Printing,  Prev: Moving and Copying,  Up: Getting Started

3.7 Loading and Saving
======================

After your first experience with `Pcb' you will probably want to save
your work. `:s name' passes the data to an external program which is
responsible for saving it. For details see _saveCommand_ in *note
Resources::.  Saving also is available from the _File_ menu, either
with or without supplying a filename. `Pcb' reuses the last filename if
you do not pass a new one to the save routine.

   To load an existing layout either select _Open..._ from the _File_
menu or use `:l filename'. A file select box pops up if you don't
specify a filename. Merging existing layouts into the new one is
supported either by the _File_ menu or by `:m filename'.

   `Pcb' saves a backup of the current layout at a user specified
interval.  The backup filename is created by appending a dash, "-", to
the `.pcb' filename.  For example, if you are editing the layout in
`projects/board.pcb' then the backup file name will be
`projects/board.pcb-'.  If the layout is new and has not been saved
yet, then the backup file name is `PCB.####.backup' where the "####"
will be replaced by the process ID of the currenting running copy of
`Pcb'.  This default backup file name may be changed at compilation
time via the `BACKUP_NAME' variable in `globalconfig.h').  During
critical sections of the program or when data would be lost it is saved
as `PCB.%i.save'.  This file name may be changed at compile time with
the `SAVE_NAME' variable in `globalconfig.h'.

3.8 Printing
============

`Pcb' now has support for device drivers, `PostScript', _encapsulated
PostScript_, and _Gerber RS-274X_ drivers are available so far.  The
_Gerber RS-274X_ driver additionally generates a numerical control (NC)
drill file for automated drilling, a bill of materials file to assist
in materials procurement and inventory control, and a centroid (X-Y)
file which includes the centroid data needed by automatic assembly
(pick and place) machines.   I recommend the use of `GhostScript' if you
don't have a `PostScript' printer for handling the PostScript output.
Printing always generates a complete set of files for a specified
driver.  See the page about the _Print()_ action for additional
information about the filenames.  The control panel offers a number of
options. Most of them are not available for Gerber output because it
wouldn't make sense, for example,  to scale the gerber output (you'd
get an incorrectly made board!)  The options are:

`device'
     The top menu button selects from the available device drivers.

`rotate'
     Rotate layout 90 degrees counter-clockwise before printing
     (default).

`mirror'
     Mirror layout before printing. Use this option depending on your
     production line.

`color'
     Created colored output. All colors will be converted to black if
     this option is inactive.

`outline'
     Add a board outline to the output file. The size is determined by
     the maximum board size changeable from the _sizes_ menu. The
     outline appears on the top and bottom sides of the board, but not
     on the internal layers.  An outline can be useful for determining
     where to shear the board from the panel, but be aware that it
     creates a copper line.  Thus it has the potential to cause short
     circuits if you don't leave enough room from your wiring to the
     board edge.  Use a viewer to see what the output outline looks like
     if you want to know what it looks like.

`alignment'
     Additional alignment targets are added to the output. The
     distances between the board outline is set by the resource
     _alignmentDistance_.  Alignment targets should only be used if you
     know for certain that YOU WILL BE USING THEM YOURSELF.  It is
     extremely unlikely that you will want to have alignment targets if
     you send gerber files to a commercial pcb manufacture to be made.

`scaling'
     It's quite useful to enlarge your printout for checking the layout.
     Use the scrollbar to adjust the scaling factor to your needs.

`media'
     Select the size of the output media from this menu. The user
     defined size may be set by the resource _media_ either from one of
     the well known paper sizes or by a `X11' geometry specification.
     This entry is only available if you use `X11R5' or later.  For
     earlier releases the user defined size or, if not available, _A4_
     is used.  Well known size are:
          	A3
          	A4
          	A5
          	letter
          	tabloid
          	ledger
          	legal
          	executive

`offset'
     Adjust the offsets of the printout by using the panner at the
     right side of the dialog box.  This entry is only available if you
     use `X11R5' or later. A zero offset is used for earlier releases.

`8.3 filenames'
     Select this button to generate DOS compatible filenames for the
     output files.  The _command_ input area will disappear if selected.

`commandline'
     Use this line to enter a command (starts with `|') or a filename.
     A %f is replaced by the current filename.  The default is set by
     the resource _printCommand_.


   The created file includes some labels which are guaranteed to stay
unchanged
`PCBMIN'
     identifies the lowest x and y coordinates in mil.

`PCBMAX'
     identifies the highest x and y coordinates in mil.

`PCBOFFSET'
     is set to the x and y offset in mil.

`PCBSCALE'
     is a floating point value which identifies the scaling factor.

`PCBSTARTDATA'
`PCBENDDATA'
     all layout data is included between these two marks. You may use
     them with an `awk' script to produce several printouts on one
     piece of paper by duplicating the code and putting some
     `translate' commands in front.  Note, the normal `PostScript'
     units are 1/72 inch.

   The elements are enlarged in order to compensate for the cutting
tool size so that the remaining copper corresponds to the original
size; however all polygons are left unchanged and will end up being a
little smaller; this is not a problem because the electrical connection
is done with traces, which are correctly enlarged.

   A .cnc file is generated for every copper layer, with the bottom
layer mirrored so that the milling is done right; of course it's not
possible to produce directly multi-layer (more than 2) pcb's with this
method, but the cnc files for intermediate layers are generated anyways.

   A drill file is also generated, and it contains all drills
regardless of the hole size; the drilling sequence is optimized in
order to require the least amount of movement.

   The export function generates an intermediate raster image before
extracting the contour of copper elements, and this image is saved as
well (in .png format) for inspection.

   When the spacing between two elements is less than the tool diameter
they will merge and no isolation will be cut between them; the control
image should be checked for this behaviour.

   Possible workarounds are: increasing spacing, decreasing the tool
size, increasing the intermediate image resolution.

   To maximize the chance of producing correct pcb's it would be better
to increase the DRC clearance to at least the tool diameter and use
traces as thick as possible; the rule is: use the largest element that
will not prevent the isolation cut.

   The exporter parameters are:

basename
     base name for generated files

dpi
     intermediate image resolution; affects precision when extracting
     contours

mill depth
     should be the copper depth

safe z
     Z value when moving between polygons

tool radius
     copper elements are enlarged by this amount

drill depth
     depth of drills

measurement unit
     for all parameters above, can be mm,um,inch,mil; g-code is always
     mm or inch

   All .cnc files specify Z values as parameters, so that it's easy to
change them without the need to run the exporter again.

   Operation was verified with the EMC2 g-code interpreter.

File: pcb.info,  Node: Connection Lists,  Prev: Vendor drill mapping,  Up: Getting Started

3.10 Connection Lists
=====================

After completing parts of your layout you may want to check if all drawn
connections match the ones you have in mind. This is probably best done
in conjunction with a net-list file: see *note Rats Nest::.  The
following examples give more rudimentary ways to examine the
connections.
         1) create at least two elements and name them
         2) create some connections between their pins
         3) optionally add some vias and connections to them

   Now select _lookup connection_ from the _Connections_ menu, move the
cursor to a pin or via and press any mouse button. `Pcb' will look for
all other pins and/or vias connected to the one you have selected and
display the objects in a different color.  Now try some of the reset
options available from the same menu.

   There also is a way to scan all connections of one element. Select
_a single element_ from the menu and press any button at the element's
location. All connections of this element will be saved to the
specified file.  Either the layout name of the element or its canonical
name is used to identify pins depending on the one which is displayed
on the screen (may be changed by _Display_ menu).

   An automatic scan of all elements is initiated by choosing _all
elements_. It behaves in a similar fashion to scanning a single element
except the resource _resetAfterElement_ is used to determine if
connections should be reset before a new element is scanned. Doing so
will produce very long lists because the power lines are rescanned for
every element. By default the resource is set to _false_ for this
reason.

   To scan for unconnected pins select _unused pins_ from the same menu.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Arrow Tool,  Next: Rats Nest,  Prev: Exporting,  Up: Getting Started

3.11 Arrow Tool
===============

Some commands mentioned earlier in this chapter also are able to
operate on all selected and visible objects. The Arrow tool is used to
select/deselect objects and also to move objects or selections.  If you
click and release on an object with the Arrow tool, it will unselect
everything else and select the object. Selected objects change color to
reflect that they are selected. If you _Shift_ click, it will add the
object to (or remove) the object from the existing selection. If you
drag with the mouse button down with the Arrow tool, one of several
things could happen: if you first pressed the button on a selected
object, you will be moving the selection to where you release the
button. If you first pressed the button on an unselected object, you
will be moving that object. If you first pressed the button over empty
space, you will be drawing a box to select everything inside the box.
The _Shift_ key works the same way with box selections as it does with
single objects.

   Moving a single un-selected object is different from moving a
selection.  First of all, you can move the end of line, or a point in a
polygon this way which is impossible by moving selections. Secondly, if
rubber banding is turned on, moving a single object will rubber-band
the attached lines.  Finally, it is faster to move a single object this
way since there is no need to select it first.

   You can select any visible object unless it is locked. If you select
an object, then turn off its visibility with the Layer controls, it
won't be moved if you move the remaining visible selection.

   If you have not configured to use strokes in the `Pcb' user
interface, then the middle mouse button is automatically bound to the
arrow tool, regardless of the active tool (which is bound to the first
mouse button). So using the middle button any time is just like using
the first mouse button with the Arrow tool active.

   The entries of the _Selection_ menu are hopefully self-explanatory.
Many of the _Action Commands_ can take various key words that make them
function on all or some of the selected items.

3.12 Rats Nest
==============

If you have a netlist that corresponds to the layout you are working
on, you can use the rats-nest feature to add rat-lines to the layout.
First you will need to load a netlist file (see _:rn_, *note User
Commands::).  _<Key>w_ adds rat-lines on the active layer using the
current line thickness shown in the status line (usually you'll want
them to be thin lines).  Only those rat-lines that fill in missing
connectivity (since you have probably routed some connections already)
are added.  If the layout is already completely wired, nothing will be
added, and you will get a message that the wiring is complete.

   Rat-lines are lines having the special property that they only
connect to pins and pads at their end points.  Rat-lines may be drawn
differently to other lines to make them easier to identify since they
have special behavior and cannot remain in a completed layout.
Rat-lines are added in the minimum length straight-line tree pattern
(always ending on pins or pads) that satisfies the missing connectivity
in the circuit.  Used in connection with moves and rotates of the
elements, they are extremely useful for deciding where to place
elements on the board. The rat-lines will always automatically
rubberband to the elements whether or not the rubberband mode is on.
The only way for you to move them is by moving the parts they connect
to.  This is because it is never desirable to have the rat-lines
disconnected from their element pins.  Rat-lines will normally
criss-cross all over which gives rise to the name "rats nest"
describing a layout connected with them.  If a SMD pad is unreachable
on the active layer, a warning will be issued about it and the rat-line
to that pad will not be generated.

   A common way to use rats nests is to place some elements on the
board, add the rat-lines, and then use a series of moves/rotates of the
elements until the rats nest appears to have minimum tangling.  You may
want to iterate this step several times. Don't worry if the layout
looks messy - as long as you can get a sense for whether the
criss-crossing is better or worse as you move things, you're fine.
After moving some elements around, you may want to optimize the rats
nest _<Key>o_ so that the lines are drawn between the closest points
(this can change once you've moved components).  Adding rat-lines only
to selected pads/pins (_Shift<Key>w_) is often useful to layout a
circuit a little bit at a time.  Sometimes you'll want to delete all
the rat-lines (_<Key>e_) or selected rat-lines (_Shift<Key>e_) in order
to reduce confusion.  With a little practice you'll be able to achieve
a near optimal component placement with the use of a rats nest.

   Rat-lines are not only used for assisting your element placement,
they can also help you to route traces on the board.  Use the _<Key>m_
to convert a rat-line under the cursor into a normal line on the active
layer.  Inserting a point into a rat-line will also cause the two new
lines to be normal lines on the board.  Another way that you can use
rat-lines is to use the _<Key>f_ with the cursor over a pad or pin.
All of the pins and pads and rat-lines belonging to that net will be
highlighted. This is a helpful way to distinguish one net from the rest
of the rats nest.  You can then route those tracks, turn off the
highlighting (_Shift<Key>f_) and repeat the process. This will work even
if the layer that the rat-lines reside on is made invisible - so only
the pins and pads are highlighted.  Be sure to erase the rat-lines
(_<Key>e_ erases them all) once you've duplicated their connectivity by
adding your own lines.  When in doubt, the _<Key>o_ will delete only
those rat-lines that are no longer needed.

   If connections exist on the board that are not listed in the netlist
when _<Key>w_ is pressed, warning messages are issued and the affected
pins and pads are drawn in a special _warnColor_ until the next
_Notify()_ event.  If the entire layout agrees completely with the
netlist, a message informs you that the layout is complete and no
rat-lines will be added (since none are needed).  If the layout is
complete, but still has rat-lines then you will be warned that
rat-lines remain. If you get no message at all it's probably because
some elements listed in the net list can't be found and where reported
in an earlier message.  There shouldn't be any rat-lines left in a
completed layout, only normal lines.

   The _Shift<Key>w_ is used to add rat-lines to only those missing
connections among the selected pins and pads.  This can be used to add
rat-lines in an incremental manner, or to force a rat-line to route
between two points that are not the closest points within the net.
Often it is best to add the rats nest in an incremental fashion, laying
out a sub-section of the board before going further. This is easy to
accomplish since new rat-lines are never added where routed
connectivity already makes the necessary connections.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Design Rule Checking,  Next: Trace Optimizer,  Prev: Rats Nest,  Up: Getting Started

3.13 Design Rule Checking
=========================

After you've finished laying out a board, you may want to check to be
certain that none of your interconnections are too closely spaced or
too tenuously touching to be reliably fabricated. The design rule
checking (DRC) function does this for you. Use the command ":DRC()"
(without the quotes of course) to invoke the checker.  If there are no
problem areas, you'll get a message to that effect.  If any problem is
encountered, you will get a message about it and the affected traces
will be highlighted. One part of the tracks of concern will be
selected, while the other parts of concern will have the
"FindConnection" highlighting. The screen will automatically be
centered in the middle of the object having the "FindConnection"
(Green) highlighting.  The middle of the object is also the coordinates
reported to be "near" the problem.  The actual trouble region will be
somewhere on the boundary of this object.  If the two parts are from
different nets then there is some place where they approach each other
closer than the minimum rule.  If the parts are from the same net, then
there is place where they are only barely connected. Find that place
and connect them better.

   After a DRC error is found and corrected you must run the DRC again
because the search for errors is halted as soon as the first problem is
found. Unless you've been extremely careless there should be no more
than a few design rule errors in your layout.  The DRC checker does not
check for minimum spacing rules to copper text, so always be very
careful when adding copper text to a layout.  The rules for the DRC are
specified in the application resource file.  The minimum spacing value
(in mils) is given by the _Settings.Bloat_ value. The default is 7
mils. The minimum touching overlap (in mils) is given by the
_Settings.Shrink_ value. This value defaults to 5 mils. Check with your
fabrication process people to determine the values that are right for
you.

   If you want to turn off the highlighting produced by the DRC,
perform an undo (assuming no other changes have been made).  To restore
the highlighting, use redo.  The redo will restore the highlighting
quickly without re-running the DRC checker.

3.14 Trace Optimizer
====================

PCB includes a flexible trace optimizer.  The trace optimizer can be run
after auto routing or hand routing to clean up the traces.

Auto-Optimize
     Performs debumpify, unjaggy, orthopull, vianudge, and viatrim, in
     that order, repeating until no further optimizations are performed.

Debumpify
     Looks for U shaped traces that can be shortened or eliminated.

Unjaggy
     Looks for corners which could be flipped to eliminate one or more
     corners (i.e. jaggy lines become simpler).

Vianudge
     Looks for vias where all traces leave in the same direction. Tries
     to move via in that direction to eliminate one of the traces (and
     thus a corner).

Viatrim
     Looks for traces that go from via to via, where moving that trace
     to a different layer eliminates one or both vias.

Orthopull
     Looks for chains of traces all going in one direction, with more
     traces orthogonal on one side than on the other. Moves the chain
     in that direction, causing a net reduction in trace length,
     possibly eliminating traces and/or corners.

SimpleOpts
     Removing unneeded vias, replacing two or more trace segments in a
     row with a single segment. This is usually performed automatically
     after other optimizations.

Miter
     Replaces 90 degree corners with a pair of 45 degree corners, to
     reduce RF losses and trace length.

3.16 Measuring distances
========================

To measure distances, for example the pin-to-pin pitch of a part to
validate a footprint, place the cursor at the starting measurement
point, then press _!Ctrl<Key>m_.  This marks the current  location with
a _X_. The _X_ mark is now the zero point origin for the relative
cursor position display.  The cursor display shows both absolute
position and position relative to the mark as the mouse is moved away
from the mark.  If a mark is already present, the mark is removed and
the cursor display stops displaying relative cursor coordinates.

3.17 Vendor Drill Mapping
=========================

`Pcb' includes support for mapping drill holes to a specified set of
sizes used by a particular vendor.  Many PCB manufacturers have a
prefered set of drill sizes and charge extra when others are used.  The
mapping can be performed on an existing design and can also be enabled
to automatically map drill holes as vias and elements are instantiated.

   The first step in using the vendor drill mapping feature is to create
a resource file describing the capabilities of your vendor.  The file
format is the resource file format described in *note Resource Syntax::.
A complete example is given below.

     # Optional name of the vendor
     vendor = "Vendor Name"

     # units for dimensions in this file.
     # Allowed values:  mil/inch/mm
     units = mil

     # drill table
     drillmap = {
        # When mapping drill sizes, select the nearest size
        # or always round up.  Allowed values:  up/nearest
        round = up

        # The list of vendor drill sizes.  Units are as specified
        # above.
        20
        28
        35
        38
        42
        52
        59.5
        86
       125
       152

        # optional section for skipping mapping of certain elements
        # based on reference designator, value, or description
        # this is useful for critical parts where you may not
        # want to change the drill size.  Note that the strings
        # are regular expressions.
        skips = {
           {refdes "^J3$"}  # Skip J3.
           {refdes "J3"}  # Skip anything with J3 as part of the refdes.
           {refdes "^U[1-3]$" "^X.*"} # Skip U1, U2, U3, and anything starting with X.
           {value "^JOHNSTECH_.*"} # Skip all Johnstech footprints based on the value of a part.
           {descr "^AMP_MICTOR_767054_1$"} # Skip based on the description.
        }
     }

     # If specified, this section will change the current DRC
     # settings for the design.  Units are as specified above.
     drc = {
        copper_space = 7
        copper_width = 7
        silk_width = 10
        copper_overlap = 4
     }

   The vendor resource is loaded using the _LoadVendor_ action.  This
is invoked by entering:
     :LoadVendor(vendorfile)
   from within `Pcb'.  Substitute the file name of your vendor resource
file for `vendorfile'.  This action will load the vendor resource and
modify all the drill holes in the design as well as the default via
hole size for the various routing styles.

   Once a vendor drill map has been loaded, new vias and elements will
automatically have their drill hole sizes mapped to the vendor drill
table.  Automatic drill mapping may be disabled under the "Settings"
menu.  To re-apply an already loaded vendor drill table to a design,
choose "Apply vendor drill mapping" from the "Connects" menu.

   See *note Actions:: for a complete description of the actions
associated with vendor drill mapping.

   Note that the expressions used in the `skips' section are regular
expressions.  See *note Regular Expressions:: for an introduction to
regular expressions.

4 Autorouter
************

`Pcb' includes an autorouter which can greatly speed up the layout of a
circuit board.  The autorouter is a rectangle-expansion type of
autorouter based on "A Method for Gridless Routing of Printed Circuit
Boards" by A. C. Finch, K. J. Mackenzie, G. J. Balsdon, and G. Symonds
in the 1985 Proceedings of the 22nd ACM/IEEE Design Automation
Conference.  This reference is available from the ACM Digital Library at
`http://www.acm.org/dl' for those with institutional or personal access
to it.  It's also available from your local engineering library.  The
reference paper is not needed for using the autorouter.

   Before using the autorouter, all elements need to be loaded into the
layout and placed and the connectivity netlist must be loaded.  Once
the elements have been placed and the netlist loaded, the following
steps will autoroute your design.

  1. Turn off visibility of any layers that you don't want the router
     to use.

  2. Turn of via visibility if you don't want the router to use any new
     vias.

  3. Use only plain rectangles for power/ground planes that you want
     the router to use [use the rectangle tool!]

  4. Make at least one connection from any plane you want the router to
       use to the net you want it to connect to.

  5. Draw continuous lines (on all routing layers) to outline keep-out
      zones if desired.

  6. Use routing styles in the netlist to have per-net routing styles.
      Note that the routing style will be used for an entire net.  This
     means   if you have a wide metal setting for a power net you will
     need to manually   route breakouts from any fine pitch parts on
     their power pins because   the router will not be able to change
     to a narrow trace to connect   to the part.

  7. Set the current routing style to whatever you'd like the router to
       use for any nets not having a defined route style in the netlist.

  8. Disable any nets that you don't want the autorouter to route
     (double-click them in the  netlist window to add/remove the *)

     NOTE: If you will be manually routing these later not using
     planes, it is usually better to let the autorouter route them then
     rip    them up yourself afterwards. If you plan to use a
     ground/power plane    manually, consider making it from one or
     more pure rectangles and    letting the autorouter have a go at it.

  9. Create a fresh rat's nest. ('E' the 'W')

 10. Select "show autorouter trials" in the settings menu if you want
     to watch what's happening

 11. Choose "autoroute all rats" in the connection menu.

 12. If you really want to muck with the router because you have a
     special design, e.g. all through-hole components you can mess with
       layer directional costs by editing the autoroute.c source file
     and    changing the directional costs in lines 929-940. and try
     again. Even    more mucking about with costs is possible in lines
     4540-4569, but it's    probably not such a good idea unless you
     really just want to    experiment.


   After the design has been autorouted, you may want to run the trace
optimizer.  See section *note Trace Optimizer:: for more information on
the trace optimizer.


File: pcb.info,  Node: User Commands,  Next: Command-Line Options,  Prev: Autorouter,  Up: Top

5 User Commands
***************

The entering of user-commands is initiated by the action routine
_Command()_ (normally bound to the `(":")' character) which replaces
the bottom statusline with an input area or opens a separate command
window.  It is finished by either _<Key>Return_ or _<Key>Escape_ to
confirm or to abort. These two key-bindings cannot be changed from the
resource file.  The triggering event, normally a key press, is ignored.

   Commands can be entered in one of two styles, command entry syntax:
"_Command arg1 arg2_" or action script syntax "_Action1(arg1, arg2);
Action2(arg1, arg2);_".  Quoting arguments works similar to bash
quoting:

   * A backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal
     value of the next character that follows.  To get a literal '\' use
     "\\".

   * Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value
     of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur
     between single quotes, even when preceded by a blackslash.

   * Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value
     of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of '\'
     which maintains its special meaning as an escape character.

   There are simple _usage_ dialogs for each command and one for the
complete set of commands.

`l [filename]'
     Loads a new datafile (layout) and, if confirmed, overwrites any
     existing unsaved data.  The filename and the searchpath
     (_filePath_) are passed to the command defined by _fileCommand_.
     If no filename is specified a file select box will popup.

`le [filename]'
     Loads an element description into the paste buffer.  The filename
     and the searchpath (_elementPath_) are passed to the command
     defined by _elementCommand_.  If no filename is specified a file
     select box will popup.

`m [filename]'
     Loads an layout file into the paste buffer.  The filename and the
     searchpath (_filePath_) are passed to the command defined by
     _fileCommand_.  If no filename is specified a file select box will
     popup.

`q[!]'
     Quits the program without saving any data (after confirmation).
     q! doesn't ask for confirmation, it just quits.

`s [filename]'
     Data and the filename are passed to the command defined by the
     resource _saveCommand_. It must read the layout data from _stdin_.
     If no filename is entered, either the last one is used again or,
     if it is not available, a file select box will pop up.

`rn [filename]'
     Reads in a netlist file.  If no filename is given a file select
     box will pop up.  The file is read via the command defined by the
     _RatCommand_ resource. The command must send its output to
     _stdout_.

     Netlists are used for generating rat's nests (see *note Rats
     Nest::) and for verifying the board layout (which is also
     accomplished by the _Ratsnest_ command).

`w[q] [filename]'
     These commands have been added for the convenience of `vi' users
     and have the same functionality as _s_ combined with _q_.

`actionCommand'
     Causes the actionCommand to be executed.  This allows you to
     initiate actions for which no bindings exist in the resource file.
     It can be used to initiate any action with whatever arguments you
     enter.  This makes it possible to do things that otherwise would
     be extremely tedious.  For example, to change the drilling hole
     diameter of all vias in the layout to 32 mils, you could select
     everything using the selection menu, then type
     "_:ChangeDrillSize(SelectedVias, 32)_".  (This will only work
     provided the via's diameter is sufficiently large to accommodate a
     32 mil hole).  Another example might be to set the grid to 1 mil
     by typing "_:SetValue(Grid, 1)_".  Note that some actions use the
     current cursor location, so be sure to place the cursor where you
     want before entering the command.  This is one of my favorite new
     features in 1.5 and can be a powerful tool. Study the *note
     Actions:: section to see what actions are available.

File: pcb.info,  Node: Resources,  Next: Actions,  Up: X11 Interface

7.1 Non-Standard X11 Application Resources
==========================================

In addition to the toolkit resources, `Pcb' defines the following
resources:

`absoluteGrid (boolean)'
     Selects if either the grid is relative to the position where it
     has changed last or absolute, the default, to the origin (0,0).

`alignmentDistance (dimension)'
     Specifies the distance between the boards outline to the alignment
     targets.

`allDirectionLines (boolean)'
     Enables (default) or disables clipping of new lines to 45 degree
     angles.

`backgroundImage (string)'
     If specified, this image will be drawn as the background for the
     board.  The purpose of this option is to allow you to use a scan
     of an existing layout as a prototype for your new layout.  To do
     this, there are some limitations as to what this image must be.
     The image must be a PPM binary image (magic number `P6').  It must
     have a maximum pixel value of 255 or less (i.e. no 16-bit images).
     It must represent the entire board, as it will be scaled to fit
     the board dimensions exactly.  Note that it may be scaled unevenly
     if the image doesn't have the same aspect ratio of your board.
     You must ensure that the image does not use more colors than are
     available on your system (mostly this is for pseudo-color
     displays, like old 8-bit displays).  For best results, I suggest
     the following procedure using The Gimp: Load your image (any
     type).  Image->Scale if needed.  Image->Colors->Curves and for
     each of Red, Green, and Blue channel move the lower left point up
     to about the 3/4 line (value 192).  This will make your image pale
     so it doesn't interfere with the traces you'll be adding.
     Image->Mode->Indexed and select, say, 32 colors with Normal F-S
     dithering.  File->Save As, file type by extension, use `.ppm' as
     the extension.  Select Raw formatting.

`backupInterval (int)'
     `Pcb' has an automatic backup feature which saves the current data
     every n seconds. The default is _300_ seconds. A value of zero
     disables the feature. The backup file is named
     `/tmp/PCB.%i.backup' by default (this may have been changed at
     compilation time via the `BACKUP_NAME' variable in
     `globalconfig.h').  _%i_ is replaced by the process ID.  See also,
     the command-line option _-backup-interval_.

`Bloat (dimension)'
     Specifies the minimum spacing design rule in mils.

`connectedColor (color)'
     All pins, vias, lines and rectangles which are selected during a
     connection search are drawn with this color. The default value is
     determined by _XtDefaultForeground_.

`cross hairColor (color)'
     This color is used to draw the cross hair cursor. The color is a
     result of a _XOR_ operation with the contents of the Layout area.
     The result also depends on the default colormap of the `X11'
     server because only the colormap index is used in the boolean
     operation and `Pcb' doesn't create its own colormap. The default
     setting is _XtDefaultForeground_.

`elementColor (color)'
`elementSelectedColor (color)'
     The elements package part is drawn in these colors, for normal and
     selected mode, respectively, which both default to
     _XtDefaultForeground_.

`elementCommand (string)'
     `Pcb' uses a user defined command to read element files. This
     resources is used to set the command which is executed by the
     users default shell.  Two escape sequences are defined to pass the
     selected filename (%f) and the current search path (%p). The
     command must write the element data to its standard output. The
     default value is
              M4PATH="%p";export M4PATH;echo 'include(%f)' | m4
     Using the GNU version of `m4' is highly recommended.  See also,
     the command-line option _-element-command_.

`elementPath (string)'
     A colon separated list of directories or commands (starts with
     '|').  The path is passed to the program specified in
     _elementCommand_ together with the selected element name. A
     specified command will be executed in order to create entries for
     the fileselect box. It must write its results to _stdout_ one
     entry per line.  See also, the user-command _le[!]_.

`fileCommand (string)'
     The command is executed by the user's default shell whenever
     existing layout files are loaded. Data is read from the command's
     standard output.  Two escape sequences may be specified to pass
     the selected filename (%f) and the current search path (%p). The
     default value is:
              cat %f
     See also, the command-line option _-file-command_.

`filePath (string)'
     A colon separated list of directories or commands (starts with
     '|').  The path is passed to the program specified in
     _fileCommand_ together with the selected filename. A specified
     command will be executed in order to create entries for the
     fileselect box. It must write its results to _stdout_ one entry
     per line.  See also, the user-command _l[!]_.

`fontCommand (string)'
     Loading new symbol sets also is handled by an external command.
     You again may pass the selected filename and the current search
     path by passing %f and %p in the command string. Data is read from
     the commands standard output. This command defaults to
              cat %f
     See also, the command-line option _-font-command_.

`fontFile (string)'
     The default font for new layouts is read from this file which is
     searched in the directories as defined by the resource _fontPath_.
     Searching is only performed if the filename does not contain a
     directory component.  The default filename is `default_font'.

`fontPath (string)'
     This resource, a colon separated list of directories, defines the
     searchpath for font files. See also, the resource _fontFile_.

`grid (int)'
     This resources defines the initial value of one cursor step. It
     defaults to _100 mil_ and any changes are saved together with the
     layout data.

`gridColor (color)'
     This color is used to draw the grid. The color is a result of a
     _INVERT_ operation with the contents of the Layout area. The result
     also depends on the default colormap of the `X11' server because
     only the colormap index is used in the boolean operation and `Pcb'
     doesn't create its own colormap. The default setting is
     _XtDefaultForeground_.

`invisibleObjectsColor (color)'
     Elements located on the opposite side of the board are drawn in
     this color.  The default is _XtDefaultForeground_.

`layerColor1..MAX_LAYER (color)'
`layerSelectedColor1..MAX_LAYER (color)'
     These resources define the drawing colors of the different layers
     in normal and selected state. All values are preset to
     _XtDefaultForeground_.

`layerGroups (string)'
     The argument to this resource is a colon separated list of comma
     separated layer numbers (1..MAX_LAYER). All layers within one
     group are switched on/off together. The default setting is
     _1:2:3:...:MAX_LAYER_ which means all layers are handled
     separately. Grouping layers one to three looks like
     _1,2,3:4:...:MAX_LAYER_

`layerName1..MAX_LAYER (string)'
     The default name of the layers in a new layout are determined by
     these resources. The defaults are empty strings.

`libraryCommand (string)'
     `Pcb' uses a command to read element data from libraries.  The
     resources is used to set the command which is executed by the users
     default shell.  Three escape sequences are defined to pass the
     selected filename (%f), the current search path (%p) as well (%a)
     as the three parameters _template_, _value_ and _package_ to the
     command.  It must write the element data to its standard output.
     The default value is
              NONE/share/pcb/oldlib/QueryLibrary.sh %p %f %a

`libraryContentsCommand (string)'
     Similar to _libraryCommand_, `Pcb' uses the command specified by
     this resource to list the contents of a library.
          	NONE/share/pcb/oldlib/ListLibraryContents.sh %p %f
     is the default.

`libraryFilename (string)'

     commands specified by _elementCommand_ and
     _elementContentsCommand_.

`lineThickness (dimension)'
     The value, in the range [1..250] (the range may be changed at
     compile time with the `MIN_LINESIZE' and `MAX_LINESIZE' variables
     in `globalconfig.h'), defines the initial thickness of new lines.
     The value is preset to _ten mil_.

`media (<predefined> | <width>x<height>+-<left_margin>+-<top_margin>)'
     The default (user defined) media of the `PostScript' device.
     Predefined values are _a3_, _a4_, _a5_, _letter_, _tabloit_,
     _ledger_, _legal_, and _executive_.  The second way is to specify
     the medias width, height and margins in mil.  The resource
     defaults to _a4_ size unless changed at compile time with the
     `DEFAULT_MEDIASIZE' variable in `globalconfig.h'.

`offLimitColor (color)'
     The area outside the current maximum settings for width and height
     is drawn with this color. The default value is determined by
     _XtDefaultBackground_.

`pinColor (color)'
`pinSelectedColor(color)'
     This resource defines the drawing color of pins and pads in both
     states.  The values are preset to _XtDefaultForeground_.

`pinoutFont (string)'
     This fonts are used to display pin names. There is one font for
     each zoom value. The values are preset to _XtdefaultFont_.

`pinoutNameLength (int)'
     This resource limits the number of characters which are displayed
     for pin names in the pinout window. By default the string length
     is limited to _eight_ characters per name.

`pinoutOffsetX (int)'
`pinoutOffsetY (int)'
     These resources determine the offset in _mil_ of the circuit from
     the upper left corner of the window when displaying pinout
     information.  Both default to _100 mil_.

`pinoutTextOffsetX (int)'
`pinoutTextOffsetY (int)'
     The resources determine the distance in mil between the drilling
     hole of a pin to the location where its name is displayed in the
     pinout window.  They default to _X:50_ and _Y:0_.

`pinoutZoom (int)'
     Sets the zoom factor for the pinout window according to the
     formula: scale = 1:(2 power value). Its default value is _two_
     which results in a _1:4_ scale.

`printCommand (string)'
     Default file for printouts. If the name starts with a '|' the
     output is piped through the command. A %f is replaced by the
     current filename.  There is no default file or command.

`raiseLogWindow (boolean)'
     The log window will be raised when new messages arrive if this
     resource is set _true_, the default.

`ratCommand (string)'
     Default command for reading a netlist. A %f is replaced by the
     netlist filename. Its default value is "_cat %f_".

`ratPath (string)'
     Default path to look for netlist files. It's default value is "."

`resetAfterElement (boolean)'
     If set to _true_, all found connections will be reset before a new
     element is scanned. This will produce long lists when scanning the
     whole layout for connections. The resource is set to _false_ by
     default.  The feature is only used while looking up connections of
     all elements.

`ringBellWhenFinished (boolean)'
     Whether to ring the bell (the default) when a possibly lengthy
     operation has finished or not.  See also, the command-line option
     _-ring-bell-finished_.

`routeStyle (string)'
     Default values for the menu of routing styles (seen in the sizes
     menu).  The string is a comma separated list of name, line
     thickness, via diameter, and via drill size.  e.g.
     "Fat,50,100,40:Skinny,8,35,20:75Ohm,110,110,20" See also, the
     command-line option _-route-styles_ and _Sizes Menu_

`rubberBandMode (boolean)'
     Whether rubberband move and rotate (attached lines stretch like
     rubberbands) is enabled (the default).

`saveCommand (string)'
     This command is used to save data to a layout file. The filename
     may be indicated by placing `%f' in the string. It must read the
     data from its standard input.  The default command is:
              cat - > %f
     See also, the command-line option _-save-command_.

`saveInTMP (boolean)'
     Enabling this resource will save all data which would otherwise be
     lost in a temporary file `/tmp/PCB.%i.save'.  The file name may be
     changed at compile time with the `EMERGENCY_NAME' variable in
     `globalconfig.h'.  .  _%i_ is replaced by the process ID.  As an
     example, loading a new layout when the old one hasn't been saved
     would use this resource.  See also, the command-line option
     _-save-in-tmp_.

`saveLastCommand (boolean)'
     Enables the saving of the last entered user command. The option is
     _disabled_ by default.  See also, the command-line option
     _-save-last-command_.

`Shrink (dimension)'
     Specifies the minimum overlap (touching) design rule in mils.

`size (<width>x<height>)'
     Defines the width and height of a new layout. The default is
     _7000x5000_ unless changed at compile time with the `DEFAULT_SIZE'
     variable in `globalconfig.h'.

`stipllePolygons (boolean)'
     Determines whether to display polygons on the screen with a
     stippled pattern.  Stippling can create some amount of
     transparency so that you can still (to some extent) see layers
     beneath polygons.  It defaults to False.

`textScale (dimension)'
     The font scaling in percent is defined by this resource. The
     default is _100_ percent.

`useLogWindow (boolean)'
     Several subroutines send messages to the user if an error occurs.
     This resource determines if they appear inside the log window or
     as a separate dialog box. See also, the resource _raiseLogWindow_
     and the command line option _-loggeometry_.  The default value is
     _true_.

     time with the `MIN_PINORVIASIZE' and `MAX_PINEORVIASIZE' variables
     in `globalconfig.h'), with at least 20 mil of copper.  The default
     thickness is _40 mil_ and the default drilling hole is _20 mil_.

`volume (int)'
     The value is passed to `XBell()' which sets the volume of the `X'
     speaker.  The value lies in the range -100..100 and it defaults to

File: pcb.info,  Node: Actions,  Next: Translations,  Prev: Resources,  Up: X11 Interface

7.2 Actions
===========

All user accessible commands may be bound to almost any `X' event.
Almost no default binding for commands is done in the binaries, so it
is vital for the application that at least a system-wide application
resource file exists.  This file normally resides in the `share/pcb'
directory and is called `Pcb'. The bindings to which the manual refers
to are the ones as defined by the shipped resource file. Besides
binding an action to an X11 event, you can also execute any action
command using a ":" command (see *note User Commands::).

   Take special care about translations related to the functions keys
and the pointer buttons because most of the window managers use them
too.  Change the file according to your hardware/software environment.
You may have to replace all occurances of _baseTranslations_ to
_translations_ if you use a `X11R4' server.

   Passing _Object_ as an argument to an action routine causes the
object at the cursor location to be changed, removed or whatever. If
more than one object is located at the cross hair position the smallest
type is used.  If there are two of the same type the newer one is taken.
_SelectedObjects_ will handle all selected and visible objects.

`AddRats(AllRats|SelectedRats)'
     Adds rat-lines to the layout using the loaded netlist file (see
     the _:rn_, *note User Commands::.). Rat lines are added on the
     active layer using the current line thickness shown in the status
     line.  Only missing connectivity is added by the AddRats command
     so if, for example, the layout is complete nothing will be added.
     Rat lines may be drawn different to other lines on the screen to
     make them easier to identify since they cannot appear in a
     completed layout.  The rat-lines are added in the minimum length
     straight-line tree pattern (always ending on pins or pads) that
     satisfies the missing connectivity in the circuit.  If a SMD pad
     is unreachable on the active layer, a warning will be issued about
     it and the rat-line to that pad will not be generated.  If
     connections exist on the board which are not listed in the netlist
     while AllRats are being added, warning messages will be issued and
     the affected pins and pads will be drawn in a special _warnColor_
     until the next _Notify()_ event.  If the entire layout agrees
     completely with the net-list a message informs you that the layout
     is complete and no rat-lines are added (since none are needed).
     If _SelectedRats_ is passed as the argument, only those missing
     connections that might connect among the selected pins and pads
     are drawn.  Default:
          None<Key>w:	AddRats(AllRats)
          !Shift<Key>w:	AddRats(SelectedRats)
          None<Key>o:	DeleteRats(AllRats) AddRats(AllRats)
          !Shift<Key>o:	DeleteRats(SelectedRats) AddRats(SelectedRats)

`ApplyVendor()'
     Applies an already loaded vendor drill map to the design.
          ApplyVendor()

`Atomic(Save|Restore|Block|Close)'
     Controls the undo grouping of sequences of actions. Before the
     first action in a group, Atomic(Save) should be issued.  After
     each action that might be undoable, Atomic(Restore) should be
     issued.  Atomic(Block) concludes and save the undo grouping if
     there was anything in the group to undo.  Atomic(Close) concludes
     and save the undo grouping even if nothing was actually done.
     Thus it might produce an "empty" undo.  This can be useful when
     you want to use undo in a group of actions.

`Bell([-100..100])'
     Rings the bell of your display. If no value is passed the setting
     of the resource _volume_ will be used.

`ChangeClearSize(Object, value[, unit])'
`ChangeClearSize(SelectedPins|SelectedVias, value[, unit])'
     The effect of this action depends on if the soldermask display is
     presently turned on or off. If soldermask is displayed, then the
     soldermask relief size will be changed.  If soldermask display is
     turned off, then the clearance to polygons will be changed.
     _unit_ is "mil" or "mm".  If not specified the units will default
     to the internal unit of 0.01 mil.
          !Mod1<Key>k:      ChangeClearSize(Object, +2, mil)
          !Mod1 Shift<Key>k: ChangeClearSize(Object, -2, mil)

`ChangeDrillSize(Object, value[, unit])'
`ChangeDrillSize(SelectedPins|SelectedVias, value[, unit])'
     This action routine changes the drilling hole of pins and vias.
     If _value_ starts with + or -, then it adds (or subtracts) _value_
     from the current hole diameter, otherwise it sets the diameter to
     the value.  _unit_ is "mil" or "mm".  If not specified the units
     will default to the internal unit of 0.01 mil.  Default:
          !Mod1<Key>s:       Change2ndSize(Object, +5, mil)
          !Mod1 Shift<Key>s: Change2ndSize(Object, -5, mil)

`ChangeFlag(Object|SelectElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected,thermal|octagon|square,0|1)'
     Sets/clears the indicated flag.  This adds/removes thermals,
     adds/removes the flag which indicates a pin/pad should be square,
     or adds/removes the flag which indicates a pin/pad should be
     octagonal.
          :ChangeFlag(SelectedVias,thermal,1)
          :ChangeFlag(SelectedPads,square,0)

`ChangeHole(Object|SelectedVias)'
     This action routine converts a via to and from a hole.  A hole is
     a via that has no copper annulus. The drill size for the via
     determines the hole diameter.
          !Ctrl<Key>h:	ChangeHole(Object)

`ChangeName(Object)'
`ChangeName(Layer|Layout)'
     Changes the name of the visible object at the cursor location. A
     text object doesn't have a name therefore the text string itself
     is changed.  The element name currently used for display is always
     the one changed with this command.  See
     _Display(Description|NameOnPCB|Value)_ for details.  Passing
     _Layer_ changes the current layers name.  Default:
          None<Key>n: ChangeName(Object)

`ChangeOctagon(Object|SelectElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected)'
     Toggles what shape the affected pin(s) or via(s) will be drawn
     when they are not square. The shape will either be round or
     octagonal.  Default:
          !Ctrl<Key>o: ChangeOctagon(Object)

`ChangePinName(ElementName, PinNumber, PinName)'
     Changes the name for a specified pin or pad number on a specified
     element.  This action is typically used to forward annotate
     pin/pad names from a schematic to the layout.
          ChangePinName(U1, 14, VDD)

`ChangeSize(Object, value[, unit])'
`ChangeSize(SelectedLines|SelectedPins|SelectedVias, value[, unit])'
`ChangeSize(SelectedPads|SelectedTexts|SelectedNames, value[, unit])'
`ChangeSize(SelectedElements, value[, unit])'
     To change the size of an object you have to bind these action to
     some `X' event (or use :ChangeSize(...)).  If _value_ begins with
     a + or - then the value will be added (or subtracted) from the
     current size, otherwise the size is set equal to _value_. Range
     checking is done to insure that none of the maximum/minimums of
     any size are violated.  If _Object_ is passed then a single object
     at the cursor location is changed. If any of the _Selected_
     arguments are passed then all selected and visible objects of that
     type are changed. If the type being modified is an element, then
     the thickness of the silkscreen lines defining the element is
     changed.  _unit_ is "mil" or "mm".  If not specified the units
     will default to the internal unit of 0.01 mil.  Default:
          None<Key>s:   ChangeSize(Object, +5)
          !Shift<Key>s: ChangeSize(Object, -5)

`ChangeSquare(Object|SelectedElements|SelectedPins)'
     Toggles the setting of the square flag. The flag is used to
     identify a certain pin, normally the first one, of circuits. It is
     also used to make SMD pads have square ends.
          None<Key>q:   ChangeSquare(Object)

`ClrFlag(Object|SelectElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected,thermal|octagon|square)'
     Clears the indicated flag.  This removes thermals, removes the flag
     which indicates a pin/pad should be square, or removes the flag
     which indicates a pin/pad should be octagonal.
          :ClrFlag(SelectedVias,thermal)

`Command()'
     Calling _Command()_ pops up an input line at the bottom of the
     window which allows you to enter commands. Including all action
     commands!  The dialog ends when _None<Key>Return_ to confirm or
     _None<Key>Escape_ to abort is entered.  Default:
          <Key>colon: Command()

`Connection(Find)'
`Connection(ResetFoundLinesAndRectangles|ResetPinsViasAndPads|Reset)'
     The _Connection()_ action is used to mark all connections from one
     pin, line or via to others.  The _ResetFoundLinesAndRectangles,
     ResetFoundPinsAndVias_ and _Reset_ arguments may be used to reset
     all marked lines and rectangles, vias and pins or all of them. The
     search starts with the pin or via at the cursor position. All
     found objects are drawn with the color defined by the resource
     _connectedColor_.  See also,
     _Display(Description|NameOnPCB|Value)_.  Default:
          !Shift<Key>c: Connection(Reset)
          None<Key>f:   Connection(Find)
          !Shift<Key>f: Connection(Reset)

`DeleteRats(AllRats|SelectedRats)'
     This routine deletes either all rat-lines in the layout, or only
     the selected and visible ones. Non-rat-lines and other layout
     objects are unaffected.  Default:
          None<Key>e:   DeleteRats(AllRats)
          !Shift<Key>e: DeleteRats(SelectedRats)

`DisableVendor()'
     Disables automatic drill size mapping to the loaded vendor drill
     table.
          DisableVendor()

`DisperseElements(All|Selected)'
     Disperses either all elements or only the selected elements in the
     layout.  This action should be used at the start of a design to
     spread out all footprints before any placement or routing is done.
          DisperseElements(All)

`Display(Description|NameOnPCB|Value)'
`Display(Toggle45Degree|CycleClip)'
`Display(Grid|ToggleGrid)'
`Display(ToggleRubberBandMode)'
`Display(Center|ClearAndRedraw|Redraw)'
`Display(Pinout|PinOrPadName)'
     This action routines handles some output related settings. It is
     used to center the display around the cursor location and to
     redraw the output area optionally after clearing the window.
     Centering is done with respect to the _grid_ setting. Displaying
     the grid itself may be switched on and off by _Grid_ but only if
     the distance between two pixels exceeds 4 pixels.  `Pcb' is able
     to handle several labels of an element. One of them is a
     description of the functionality (eg resistor), the second should
     be a unique identifier (R1) whereas the last one is a value (100k).
     The _Display()_ action selects which of the names is displayed.
     It also controls which name will be affected by the _ChangeName_
     command.  If _ToggleGrid_ is passed, `Pcb' changes between relative
     ('rel' in the statusline) and absolute grid (an 'abs' in the
     statusline).  Relative grid means the pointer position when the
     command is issued is used as the grid origin; while (0,0) is used
     in the absolute grid case.  Passing _Pinout_ displays the pinout
     of the element at the current cursor location whereas
     _PinOrPadName_ toggles displaying of the pins or pads name under
     the cursor. If none of them matches but the cursor is inside of an
     element, the flags is toggled for all of its pins and pads.  For
     details about rubberbands see also the details about _Mode_.
     Default:
          None<Key>c:  Display(Center)
          None<Key>d:  Display(PinOrPadName)
          !Shift<Key>d: Display(Pinout)
          None<Key>r:  Display(ClearAndRedraw)
          None<Key>.:  Display(Toggle45Degree)
          None<Key>/:  Display(CycleClip)

`DRC()'
     Initiates design rule checking of the entire layout. Must be
     repeated until no errors are found.

`ExecuteFile(filename)'
     Executes the PCB actions contained in the specified file.  This
     can be used to automate a complex sequence of operations.
          :ExecuteFile(custom.cmd)
     The command file contains a list of PCB actions.  Blank lines are
     ignored and lines starting with a # are treated as comment lines.
     For example
          # This is a comment line
          Display(Grid)
          SetValue(Zoom,2)
          DRC()

`EditLayerGroups()'
     Pops up a dialog box to edit the layergroup setting. The function
     is also available from the _Objects_ menu.  There are no defaults.

`EnableVendor()'
     Enables automatic drill size mapping to the loaded vendor drill
     table.
          EnableVendor()

`Load(ElementToBuffer|Layout|LayoutToBuffer|Nelist)'
     This routine pops up a fileselect box to load layout, element data,
     or netlist.  The passed filename for layout data is saved and may
     be reused.  _ElementToBuffer_ and _LayoutToBuffer_ load the data
     into the current buffer.  There are no defaults.

`LoadVendor(vendorfile)'
     Loads the specified vendor resource file.
          LoadVendor(myvendor.res)

`MarkCrosshair()'
     This routine marks the current cursor location with an X, and then
     the cursor display shows both absolute position and position
     relative to the mark.  If a mark is already present, this routine
     removes it and stops displaying relative cursor coordinates.
     Defaults:
          !Ctrl<key>m:	MarkCrosshair()

`Mode(Copy|InsertPoint|Line|Move|None|PasteBuffer|Polygon|Thermal)'
`Mode(Remove|Rectangle|RubberbandMove|Text|Via)'
`Mode(Cycle)'
`Mode(Notify)'
`Mode(Save|Restore)'
     Switches to a new mode of operation. The active mode is displayed
     by a thick line around the matching mode selector button.  Most of
     the functionality of `Pcb' is implemented by selecting a mode and
     calling _Mode(Notify)_. The arguments _Line_, _Polygon_,
     _Rectangle_, _Text_ and _Via_ are used to create the appropriate
     object whenever _Mode(Notify)_ is called. Some of them, such as
     _Polygon_, need more than one call for one object to be created.
     _InsertPoint_ adds points to existing polygons or lines.  _Save_
     and _Restore_ are used to temporarily save the mode, switch to
     another one, call _Mode(Notify)_ and restore the saved one. Have a
     look at the application resource file for examples.  _Copy_ and
     _Move_ modes are used to change an object's location and,
     optionally, to create a new one. The first call of _Mode(Notify)_
     attaches the object at the pointer location to the cross hair
     whereas the second one drops it to the layout. The _rubberband_
     version of move performs the move while overriding the current
     rubberband mode.  Passing _PasteBuffer_ attaches the contents of
     the currently selected buffer to the cross hair. Each call to
     _Mode(Notify)_ pastes this contents to the layout. _Mode(Cycle)_
     cycles through the modes available in the mode-button pallet.
     _Mode(None)_ switches all modes off.  Default:
          <Key>Escape:             Mode(None)
          <Key>space:              Mode(Cycle)
          None<Key>BackSpace:      Mode(Save) Mode(Remove) Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          None<Key>Delete:         Mode(Save) Mode(Remove) Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          None<Key>F1:             Mode(Via)
          None<Key>F2:             Mode(Line)
          None<Key>F3:             Mode(PasteBuffer)
          None<Key>F4:             Mode(Rectangle)
          None<Key>F5:             Mode(Text)
          None<Key>F6:             Mode(Polygon)
          None<Key>F7:             Mode(Thermal)
          None<Key>F8:		 Mode(Arc)
          None<Key>Insert:         Mode(InsertPoint)
          None<Key>[:              Mode(Save) Mode(Move) Mode(Notify)
          None<Key>]:              Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          None<Btn1>:          Mode(Notify)
          !Shift Ctrl<Btn1>:   Mode(Save) Mode(Remove) Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          None<Btn2Down>:          Mode(Save) Mode(Move) Mode(Notify)
          None<Btn2Up>:            Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          !Mod1<Btn2Down>:       Mode(Save) Mode(Copy) Mode(Notify)
          !Mod1<Btn2Up>:         Mode(Notify) Mode(Restore)
          Shift BTNMOD<Btn2Down>: Mode(Save) Mode(RubberbandMove) Mode(Notify)

`MovePointer(delta_x, delta_y)'
     With this function it is possible to move the cross hair cursor by
     using the cursor keys. The `X' server's pointer follows because
     the necessary events are generated by `Pcb'. All movements are
     performed with respect to the currently set grid value.  Default:
          None<Key>Up:      MovePointer(0, -1)
          !Shift<Key>Up:    MovePointer(0, -10)
          None<Key>Down:    MovePointer(0, 1)
          !Shift<Key>Down:  MovePointer(0, 10)
          None<Key>Right:   MovePointer(1, 0)
          !Shift<Key>Right: MovePointer(10, 0)
          None<Key>Left:    MovePointer(-1, 0)
          !Shift<Key>Left:  MovePointer(-10, 0)

`MoveToCurrentLayer(Object|SelectedObjects)'
     The function moves a single object at the cross hair location or
     all selected objects to the current layer. Elements are not
     movable by this function.  They have to be deleted and replaced on
     the other side.  If a line segment is moved and the movement would
     result in a loss of connectivity to another segment then via(s)
     are automatically added to maintain the connectivity.
          None<Key>m:       MoveToCurrentLayer(Object)
          !Shift<Key>m:     MoveToCurrentLayer(SelectedObjects)

`New()'
     Clear the current layout and starts a new one after entering its
     name.  Refer to the resource _backup_ for more information.  No
     defaults.

`PasteBuffer(AddSelected|Clear|1..5)'
`PasteBuffer(Rotate, 1..3)'
`PasteBuffer(Convert)'
     This action routine controls and selects the pastebuffer as well
     as all cut-and-paste operations. Passing a buffer number selects
     one in of the range 1..5. The statusline is updated with the new
     number.  _Rotate_ performs a number of 90 degree counter clockwise
     rotations of the buffer contents. _AddSelected_ as first argument
     copies all selected and visible objects into the buffer. Passing
     _Clear_ removes all objects from the currently selected buffer.
     _Convert_ causes the contents of the buffer (lines, arc, vias) to
     be converted into an element definition. Refer to *note
     Pastebuffer:: for examples.  Default:
          !Ctrl<Key>x:       PasteBuffer(Clear) PasteBuffer(AddSelected)
          		   Mode(PasteBuffer)
          !Shift Ctrl<Key>x: PasteBuffer(Clear) PasteBuffer(AddSelected)
          		   RemoveSelected() Mode(PasteBuffer)
          !Mod1<Key>c:       PasteBuffer(Clear) PasteBuffer(AddSelected)
          !Mod1<key>x:       PasteBuffer(Clear) PasteBuffer(AddSelected)
          		   RemoveSelected()
          !Shift<Key>1:      PasteBuffer(1)
          !Shift<Key>2:      PasteBuffer(2)
          !Shift<Key>3:      PasteBuffer(3)
          !Shift<Key>4:      PasteBuffer(4)
          !Shift<Key>5:      PasteBuffer(5)
          None<Key>F3:       Mode(PasteBuffer)

`Polygon((Close|PreviousPoint)'
     Polygons need a special action routine to make life easier. Calling
     _Polygon(PreviousPoint)_ resets the newly entered corner to the
     previous one. The Undo action will call Polygon(PreviousPoint)
     when appropriate to do so.  _Close_ creates the final segment of
     the polygon.  This may fail if clipping to 45 degree lines is
     switched on, in which case a warning is issued.  Default:
          None<Key>p:             Polygon(Close)
          !Shift<Key>p:           Polygon(Close)

`Print()'
     Pops up a print control box that lets you select the output
     device, scaling and many more options. Each run creates all files
     that are supported by the selected device. These are mask files as
     well as drilling files, silk screens and so on. The table shows
     the filenames for all possible files:
          	POSIX (extension)             8.3 filename
          		---------------------------------------------
          		*_componentmask.*             cmsk.*
          		*_componentsilk.*             cslk.*
          		*_soldermask.*                smsk.*
          		*_soldersilk.*                sslk.*
          		*_drill.*                     dril.*
          		*_groundplane.*               gpl.*
          		*_group[1..8].*     [..8].*
     The output may be sent to a post-processor by starting the
     filename with the _pipe_ `("|")' character. Any `"%f"' in a
     command is replaced with the current filename. The function is
     available from the _file_ menu.  There are no defaults.

`Quit()'
     Quits the application after confirming the operation.  Default:
          <Message>WM_PROTOCOLS: Quit()

`Redo()'
     This routine allows you to recover from the last undo command.
     You might want to do this if you thought that undo was going to
     revert something other than what it actually did (in case you are
     confused about which operations are un-doable), or if you have
     been backing up through a long undo list and over-shoot your
     stopping point.  Any change that is made since the undo in
     question will trim the redo list.  For example if you add ten
     lines, then undo three of them you could use redo to put them
     back, but if you move a line on the board before performing the
     redo, you will lose the ability to "redo" the three "undone" lines.
     Default:
          !Shift<Key>r:	Redo()

`RemoveSelected()'
     This routine removes all visible and selected objects.  There are
     no defaults.

`Report(Object|DrillReport)'
     This routine pops up a dialog box describing the various
     characteristics of an object (or piece of an object such as a pad
     or pin) in the layout at the cursor position, or a report about
     all of the drill holes in the layout.  There are no defaults.

`RouteStyle(1|2|3|4)'
     This routine copies the sizes corresponding to the numbered route
     style into the active line thickens, via diameter, and via drill
     size.  Defaults:
          !Ctrl<Key>1: RouteStyle(1)
          ...
          !Ctrl<Key>NUM_STYLES: RouteStyle(NUM_STYLES)
     The variable `NUM_STYLES' is set at compile time in
     `globalconfig.h'.

`Save(Layout|LayoutAs)'
`Save(AllConnections|AllUnusedPins|ElementConnections)'
     Passing _Layout_ saves the layout using the file from which it was
     loaded or, if it is a new layout, calls _Save(LayoutAs)_ which
     queries the user for a filename.  The values: _AllConnections_,
     _AllUnusedPins_ and _ElementConnections_ start a connection scan
     and save all connections, all unused pins or the connections of a
     single element to a file.  There are no defaults.

`Select(All|Block|Connection|ToggleObject)'
`Select(ElementByName|ObjectByName|PadByName|PinByName)'
`Select(TextByName|ViaByName)'
     Toggles either the selection flag of the object at the cross hair
     position (_ToggleObject_) or selects all visible objects, all
     inside a rectangle or all objects which have been found during the
     last connection scan. The _ByName_ functions use a *note Regular
     Expressions:: search, always case insensitive, to select the
     objects.  Default:
          None<Btn3Down>:  Select(ToggleObject)
          None<Btn3Down>,None<Btn3Motion>: See resource file - this is complex

`SetFlag(Object|SelectElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected,thermal|octagon|square)'
     Sets the indicated flag.  This adds thermals, sets the flag which
     indicates a pin/pad should be square, or sets the flag which
     indicates a pin/pad should be octagonal.
          :SetFlag(Selected,thermal)

`SetValue(Grid|LineSize|TextScale|ViaDrillingHole|ViaSize|Zoom, value)'
     Some internal values may be changed online by this function.  The
     first parameter specifies which data has to be changed. The other
     one determines if the resource is set to the passed value, if
     _value_ is specified without sign, or increments/decrements if it
     is specified with a plus or minus sign.  The function doesn't
     change any existing object only the initial values of new objects.
     Use the _ChangeSize()_ and _ChangeDrillSize()_ to change existing
     objects.  Default:
          None<Key>g:        SetValue(Grid, +5)
          !Shift<Key>g:      SetValue(Grid, -5)
          None<Key>l:        SetValue(LineSize, +5)
          !Shift<Key>l:      SetValue(LineSize, -5)
          None<Key>t:        SetValue(TextScale, +10)
          !Shift<Key>t:      SetValue(TextScale, -10)
          None<Key>v:        SetValue(ViaSize, +5)
          !Shift<Key>v:      SetValue(ViaSize, -5)
          !Mod1<Key>v:       SetValue(ViaDrillingHole, +5)
          !Mod1 Shift<Key>v: SetValue(ViaDrillingHole, -5)
          None<Key>z:        SetValue(Zoom, -1)
          !Shift<Key>z:      SetValue(Zoom, +1)

`SwapSides()'
     This routine changes the board side you are viewing.  Default:
          None<Key>Tab:      SwapSides()

`SwitchDrawingLayer(value)'
     Makes layer number 1..MAX_LAYER the current one.  Default:
          None<Key>1:        SwitchDrawingLayer(1)
          ...
          None<Key>MAX_LAYER:        SwitchDrawingLayer(MAX_LAYER)

`ToggleHideName(Object|SelectedElements)'
     Toggles whether the element's name is displayed or hidden. If it
     is hidden you won't see it on the screen and it will not appear on
     the silk layer when you print the layout.
          None<Key>h:	ToggleHideName(Object)
          !Shift<Key>h:	ToggleHideName(SelectedElements)

`ToggleVendor()'
     Toggles automatic drill size mapping to the loaded vendor drill
     table.
          ToggleVendor()

`ToggleVisibility(Layer)'
     Toggles the visibility of the layer.
          Mod1<Key>1:	ToggleVisibility(1)
          Mod1<Key>2:	ToggleVisibility(2)
          Mod1<Key>3:	ToggleVisibility(3)
          Mod1<Key>4:	ToggleVisibility(4)

`Undo()'
`Undo(ClearList)'
     The unlimited undo feature of `Pcb' allows you to recover from
     most operations that materially affect you work.  Calling _Undo()_
     without any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo) operation.
     _ClearList_ is used to release the allocated memory. _ClearList_
     is called whenever a new layout is started or loaded. See also
     _Redo_.  Default:
          None<Key>u:        Undo()
          !Shift Ctrl<Key>u: Undo(ClearList)

`UnloadVendor()'
     Unloads the loaded vendor drill table.
          UnloadVendor()

`Unselect(All|Block|Connection)'
     Unselects all visible objects, all inside a rectangle or all
     objects which have been found during the last connection scan.
     Default:
          !Shift <Btn3Down>: Mode(Save) Mode(None) Unselect(Block)
          !Shift <Btn3Up>:   Unselect(Block) Mode(Restore)

7.3 Default Translations
========================

This section covers some default translations of key and button events
as defined in the shipped default application resource file. Most of
them have already been listed in *note Actions::. `Pcb' makes use of a
nice `X11' feature; calling several action routines for one event.

`None<Key>BackSpace:'

`None<key>Delete:'
`!Shift<Key>BackSpace:'
`!Shift Ctrl<Btn1>:'
     The object at the cursor location is removed by
     _None<Key>BackSpace_ or _Shift Ctrl<Btn1>_ whereas
     _Shift<Key>BackSpace_ also removes all other objects that are
     fully-connected to the one at the cursor location.

`!Mod1 Ctrl<Key>Left:'
`!Mod1 Ctrl<Key>Right:'
`!Mod1 Ctrl<Key>Up:'
`!Mod1 Ctrl<Key>Down:'
     Scroll one page in one of the four directions.

`None<Key>Left:, !Shift<Key>Left:'
`None<Key>Right:, !Shift<Key>Right:'
`None<Key>Up:, !Shift<Key>Up:'
`None<Key>Down:, !Shift<Key>Down:'
     Move cross hair either one or ten points in grid.

`None<Key>Return:'
     Finished user input, selects the 'default' button of dialogs.

`None<Key>Escape:'
     _Mode(Reset)_, aborts user input, selects the 'abort' button of
     dialogs or resets all modes.

`None<Btn2Down>, Btn2<Motion>, None<Btn2Up>:'
`!Mod1<Btn2Down>, Btn2<Motion>, !Mod1<Btn2Up>:'
     The first sequence moves the object or element name at the cursor
     location.  The second one copies the objects. Copying isn't
     available for element names.

8 File Formats
**************

All files used by `Pcb' are read from the standard output of a command
or written to the standard input of one as plain seven bit `ASCII'. This
makes it possible to use any editor to change the contents of a layout
file.  It is the only way for element or font description files to be
created.  To do so you'll need to study the example files `example/*'
and `default_font' which are shipped with `Pcb'.  For an overview refer
to *note Intro::.

   The following sections provide the necessary information about the
syntax of the files.  Netlist files are not created by `Pcb', but it
does use them. For information on the format of a netlist file see the
_:rn_, *note User Commands::.  The commands described allow you to add
almost any additional functionality you may need. Examples are
compressed read and write access as well as archives. The commands
themselves are defined by the resources _elementCommand_,
_fileCommand_, _fontCommand_, _libraryCommand_,
_libraryContentsCommand_ and _saveCommand_.  Note that the commands are
not saved along with the data.  It is considered an advantage to have
the layout file contain all necessary information, independent of any
other files.

   One thing common to all files is they may include comments, newlines,
and carriage returns at any place except within quoted strings.

File: pcb.info,  Node: Pad and Line Representation,  Next: Layout File,  Up: File Formats

8.1 Pad and Line Representation
===============================

Pads and lines (copper traces, silk screen lines, etc) are represented
by the line end points and the aperture used to draw the line.  It is
important to understand this when creating the pads for a new
footprint.  The following figure illustrates a pad or line which is
drawn using a square aperture.  The end points (X0,Y0), (X1,Y1) specify
the center of the aperture.  The size parameter specifies the size of
the aperture.

                 [image src="pad.png" alt="Pad Layout" ]

Pads and lines are represented in this way because this is how lines are
specified in RS-274X (Gerber) files which are used for creating the
masks used in board manufacturing.  In fact, older mask making
equipment created lines in precisely this fashion.  A physical aperture
was used to pass light through onto a photosensitive film.

8.2 Layout File Format
======================

The layout file describes a complete layout including symbols, vias,
elements and layers with lines, rectangles and text. This is the most
complex file of all.  As `Pcb' has evolved, the file format has changed
several times to accommodate new features.  `Pcb' has always been able
to read all older versions of the `.pcb' file.  This allows the
migration of older designs to newer versions of the program.  Obviously
older versions of `Pcb' will not be able to properly read layout files
stored in newer versions of the file format.

   In practice it is very common for footprint libraries to contain
elements which have been defined in various versions of the `Pcb' file
format.  When faced with trying to understand an element file or layout
file which includes syntax not defined here, the best approach is to
examine the file `src/parse_y.y' which is the definitive definition of
the file format.

   The PCB layout file contains the following contents, in this order
(individual items are defined in *note File Syntax:::

`PCB'
     This names the board and sets its size

`Grid'
     Optional.

`Cursor'
     Optional.

`Flags'
     Optional.

`Groups'
     Optional.

`Styles'
     Optional.

`Symbols'
     Optional.

`Vias, Rats, Layers, and Elements'
     These may occur in any order, at this point in the file.

`Netlists'
     Optional.



File: pcb.info,  Node: Element File,  Next: Font File,  Prev: Layout File,  Up: File Formats

8.3 Element File Format
=======================

Element files are used to describe one component which then may be used
several times within one or more layouts. You will normally split the
file into two parts, one for the pinout and one for the package
description.  Using `m4' allows you to define pin names as macros in
one file and include a package description file which evaluates the
macros. See the resource _elementCommand_ for more information. The
pins (and pads) must appear in sequential order in the element file
(new in 1.5) so that pin 1 must be the first PIN(...) in the file.

   Doing things this way makes it possible to use one package file for
several different circuits. See the sample files `dil*'.

   The lowest x and y coordinates of all sub-objects of an element are
used as an attachment point for the cross hair cursor of the main
window, unless the element has a mark, in which case that's the
attachment point.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Font File,  Next: Netlist File,  Prev: Element File,  Up: File Formats

8.4 Font File Format
====================

A number of user defined Symbols are called a font. There is only one
per layout. All symbols are made of lines. See the file `default_font'
as an example.

8.5 Netlist File Format
=======================

Netlists read by `Pcb' must have this simple text form:

     netname [style] NAME-PINNUM NAME2-PINNUM2 NAME3-PINNUM3 ... [\]

for each net on the layout.  where "netname" is the name of the net
which must be unique for each net, [style] is an optional route-style
name, NAME is the layout-name name given to an element, and PINNUM is
the (usually numeric) pin number of the element that connects to the net
(for details on pin numbering see *note Element Objects::).  Spaces or
tabs separate the fields.  If the line ends with a "\" the net
continues on the next line and the "\" is treated exactly as if it were
a space.  If a NAME ends with a lower-case letter, all lower-case
letters are stripped from the end of the NAME to determine the matching
layout-name name.  For example:

          Data U1-3 U2abc-4 FLOP1a-7 Uabc3-A9

   specifies that the net called "Data" should have pin 3 of U1
connected to pin 4 of U2, to pin 7 of FLOP1 and to pin A9 of Uabc3.
Note that element name and pin number strings are case-sensitive.  It
is up to you to name the elements so that their layout-name names
agrees with the netlist.

8.6 Library Contents File Format
================================

There is nothing like a special library format. The ones that have been
introduced in 1.4.1 just use some nice (and time consuming) features of
GNU `m4'. The only predefined format is the one of the contents file
which is read during startup. It is made up of two basic line types:

     menu entry      = "TYPE="name
     contents line   = template":"package":"value":"description
     name            = String
     template        = String
     package         = String
     value           = String
     description     = String
     String          = <anything except ":", "\n" and "\r">

   No leading white spaces or comments are allowed in this file. If you
need either one, define a command that removes them before loading.
Have a look to the _libraryContentsCommand_ resource.

   The menu entry will appear in the selection menu at the top and of
the library window.

8.7 Library File Format
=======================

This section provides an overview about the existing `m4' definitions
of the elements. There are basically two different types of files. One
to define element specific data like the pinout, package and so on, the
other to define the values. For example the static RAM circuits 43256
and 62256 are very similar. They therefore share a common definition in
the macro file but are defined with two different value labels.

   The macro file entry:
     define(`Description_43256_dil', `SRAM 32Kx8')
     define(`Param1_43256_dil', 28)
     define(`Param2_43256_dil', 600)
     define(`PinList_43256_dil', ``pin1', `pin2', ...')

   And the list file:
     43256_dil:N:43256:62256

   The macro must define a description, the pin list and up to two
additional parameters that are passed to the package definitions. The
first one is the number of pins whereas the second one defines for
example the width of a package.

   It is very important to select a unique identifier for each macro. In
the example this would be _43256_dil_ which is also the templates name.
It is required by some low-level macros that _Description_, Param1_,
Param2__ and _PinList__ are perpended.

   The list file uses a syntax:
     template:package:value[:more values]

   This means that the shown example will create two element entries
with the same package and pinout but with different names.

   A number of packages are defined in `common.m4'. Included are:

     DIL packages with suffix D, DW, J, JD, JG, N, NT, P
     PLCC
     TO3
     generic connectors
     DIN 41.612 connectors
     zick-zack (SD suffix)
     15 pin multiwatt

   If you are going to start your own library please take care about
`m4' functions. Be aware of quoting and so on and, most important check
your additional entry by calling the macro:

     CreateObject(`template', `value', `package suffix')

   If quoting is incorrect an endless loop may occur (broken by a
out-of-memory message).

   The scripts in the `lib' directory handle the creation of libraries
as well as of their contents files. Querying is also supported.

   I know quite well that this description of the library
implementation is not what some out there expect. But in my opinion
it's much more useful to look at the comments and follow the macros
step by step.

8.8 File Syntax
===============

A special note about units: Older versions of `pcb' used mils (1/1000
inch) as the base unit; a value of 500 in the file meant half an inch.
Newer versions uses a "high resolution" syntax, where the base unit is
1/100 of a mil (0.000010 inch); a value of 500 in the file means 5
mils.  As a general rule, the variants of each entry listed below which
use square brackets are the high resolution formats and use the 1/100
mil units, and the ones with parentheses are the older variants and use
1 mil units.  Note that when multiple variants are listed, the most
recent (and most preferred) format is the first listed.

Arc [X Y Width Height Thickness Clearance StartAngle DeltaAngle SFlags]
Arc (X Y Width Height Thickness Clearance StartAngle DeltaAngle NFlags)
Arc (X Y Width Height Thickness StartAngle DeltaAngle NFlags)

X Y
     Coordinates of the center of the arc.

WIDTH HEIGHT
     The width and height, from the center to the edge.  The bounds of
     the circle of which this arc is a segment, is thus 2*Width by
     2*Height.

THICKNESS
     The width of the copper trace which forms the arc.

CLEARANCE
     The amount of space cleared around the arc when the line passes
     through a polygon.  The clearance is added to the thickness to get
     the thickness of the clear; thus the space between the arc and the
     polygon is Clearance/2 wide.

STARTANGLE
     The angle of one end of the arc, in degrees.  In PCB, an angle of
     zero points left (negative X direction), and 90 degrees points down
     (positive Y direction).

DELTAANGLE
     The sweep of the arc.  This may be negative.  Positive angles sweep
     counterclockwise.

SFLAGS
     Symbolic or numeric flags.

NFLAGS
     Numeric flags.

them, which is not directly used by PCB itself but may be of use by
other programs or users.

NAME
     The name of the attribute

VALUE
     The value of the attribute.  Values are always stored as strings,
     even if the value is interpreted as, for example, a number.

------------

Cursor [X Y Zoom]
Cursor (X Y Zoom)

X Y
     Location of the cursor when the board was saved.  As of November
     2012 the cursor position is not written to file anymore.  Older
     versions of pcb ignore the absence of this line in the pcb file.

ZOOM
     The current zoom factor.  Note that a zoom factor of "0" means 1
     mil per screen pixel, N means 2^N mils per screen pixel, etc.  The
     first variant accepts floating point numbers.  The special value
     "1000" means "zoom to fit"

     This field is ignored by PCB.

     The description of the element.  This is one of the three strings
     which can be displayed on the screen.

NAME
     The name of the element, usually the reference designator.

VALUE
     The value of the element.

MX MY
     The location of the element's mark.  This is the reference point
     for placing the element and its pins and pads.

TX TY
     The upper left corner of the text (one of the three strings).

TDIR
     The relative direction of the text.  0 means left to right for an
     unrotated element, 1 means up, 2 left, 3 down.

     Symbolic or numeric flags, for the text.

TNFLAGS
     Numeric flags, for the text.

   Elements may contain pins, pads, element lines, element arcs,
attributes, and (for older elements) an optional mark.  Note that
element definitions that have the mark coordinates in the element line,
only support pins and pads which use relative coordinates.  The pin and
pad coordinates are relative to the mark.  Element definitions which do
not include the mark coordinates in the element line, may have a Mark
definition in their contents, and only use pin and pad definitions
which use absolute coordinates.

     If set, this object has been found by `FindConnection()'.

`0x0008 hole'
     For pins and vias, this flag means that the pin or via is a hole
     without a copper annulus.

`0x0008 nopaste'
     For pads, set to prevent a solderpaste stencil opening for the
     pad.  Primarily used for pads used as fiducials.

`0x0010 rat'
     If set for a line, indicates that this line is a rat line instead
     of a copper trace.

     For pins and pads, this flag is used internally to indicate that
     the pin or pad overlaps a polygon on some layer.

`0x0010 clearpoly'
     For polygons, this flag means that pins and vias will normally
     clear these polygons (thus, thermals are required for electrical
     connection).  When clear, polygons will solidly connect to pins and
     vias.

     only the biggest one).

`0x0040 selected'
     Set when the object is selected.

`0x0080 onsolder'
     For elements and pads, indicates that they are on the solder side.

`0x0080 auto'

`0x0200 warn'
     For pins, vias, and pads, set to indicate a warning.

`0x0400 usetherm'
     Obsolete, indicates that pins/vias should be drawn with thermal
     fingers.

     Set for objects that fail DRC.

`0x2000 lock'
     Set for locked objects.

`0x4000 edge2'
     For pads, indicates that the second point is closer to the edge.
     For pins, indicates that the pin is closer to a horizontal edge
     and thus pinout text should be vertical.

`0x8000 marker'
     Marker used internally to avoid revisiting an object.

`0x10000 connected'

9 Library Creation
******************

This chapter provides a detailed look at how footprint libraries are
created and used.  The chapter is split into two section, the first
section covers the "old" style libraries which use the `m4' macro
processor and the second section covers the "new" style libraries.

   Despite the names "old" and "new", both styles of libraries are
useful and the "old" style should not be discounted because of its
name.  The advantage of the old style libraries is that one can define
a family of footprints, say a DIP package, and then quickly produce all
the members of that family.  Because the individual packages make use
of a base definition, corrections made to the base definition propagate
to all the members of a family.  The primary drawback to using this
library approach is that the effort to create a single footprint is
more than a graphical interface and may take even longer if the user
has not used the `m4' macro language previously.

   The new style of footprint libraries stores each footprint in its own
file.  The footprints are created graphically by placing pads and then
converting a group of pads to a component.  This library method has the
advantage of being quick to learn and it is easily to build single
footprints quickly.  If you are building a family of parts, however, the
additional effort in creating each one individually makes this approach
undesirable.  In addition, creating a part with a large pin count can
be quite tedious when done by hand.

9.1 Old Style (m4) Libraries
============================

The old style libraries for pcb use the `m4' macro processor to allow
the definition of a family of parts.  There are several files
associated with the old style library.  The file `common.m4' is the top
level file associated with the library.  `common.m4' defines a few
utility macros which are used by other portions of the library, and
then includes a predefined set of library files (the lines like
`include(geda.inc)').

9.1.1 Overview of Oldlib Operation
----------------------------------

The big picture view of the old style library system is that the library
is simply a collection of macro definitions.  The macros are written in
the `m4' macro language.  An example of a macro and what it expands to
is the following.  One of the predefined footprints in the library
which comes with PCB is the `PKG_SO8' macro.  Note that all the
footprint macros begin with `PKG_'.  For this particular example,
`PKG_SO8' is a macro for an 8-pin small outline surface mount package.
All of the footprint macros take 3 arguments.  The first is the
canonical name of the footprint on the board.  In this case "SO8" is an
appropriate name.  The second argument is the reference designator on
the board such as "U1" or "U23".  The third and final argument is the
value.  For an integrated circuit this is usually the part number such
as "MAX4107" or "78L05" and for a component such as a resistor or
capacitor it is the resistance or capacitance.  The complete call to the
macro in our example is `PKG_SO8(SO8, U1, MAX4107)'.  When processed by
`m4' using the macros defined in the PCB library, this macro expands to
     Element(0x00 "SO8" "U1" "MAX4107" 146 50 3 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pad(10 25 38 25 20 "1" 0x00)
     	Pad(10 75 38 75 20 "2" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 125 38 125 20 "3" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 175 38 175 20 "4" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 175 242 175 20 "5" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 125 242 125 20 "6" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 75 242 75 20 "7" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 25 242 25 20 "8" 0x100)
     	ElementLine(0 0 151 0 10)
     	ElementArc(126 0 25 25 0 180 10)
     	ElementLine(101 0 252 0 10)
     	ElementLine(252 0 252 200 10)
     	ElementLine(252 200 0 200 10)
     	ElementLine(0 200 0 0 10)
     	Mark(29 25)
     )
   which is the actual definition of the footprint that the PCB program
works with.  As a user of PCB the only time you will need or want to run
`m4' directly is when you are debugging a new library addition.  In
normal operation, the calls to `m4' are made by helper scripts that
come with PCB.

   Tools such as `gsch2pcb' (used to interface the gEDA schematic
capture program to PCB layout) will call `m4' to produce an initial PCB
layout that includes all the components on a schematic.  In addition,
when manually instantiating parts from within PCB, `m4' will be called
by PCB's helper scripts to produce the footprints.

9.1.2 The Library Scripts
-------------------------

There are several scripts that are used for processing the m4
libraries.  This section briefly describes these scripts and details how
they are used by PCB.

9.1.2.1 Scripts Used During Compilation
.......................................

The scripts described in this section are used during compilation of
PCB.  They are run automatically by the build system, but are described
here to help document the complete library processing that occurs.
During the build of PCB, the following actions are taken.  The
`CreateLibrary.sh' script is run to produce an M4 "frozen file".  This
frozen file is simply a partially processed M4 input file which can be
loaded by M4 more quickly than the original input file.

   A typical call to `CreateLibrary.sh' used during the compilation of
PCB is:
     ./CreateLibrary.sh -I . pcblib ./common.m4 TTL_74xx_DIL.m4
     connector.m4 crystal.m4 generic.m4 genericsmt.m4 gtag.m4
     jerry.m4 linear.m4 logic.m4 lsi.m4 memory.m4 optical.m4 pci.m4
     resistor_0.25W.m4 resistor_adjust.m4 resistor_array.m4
     texas_inst_amplifier.m4 texas_inst_voltage_reg.m4
     transistor.m4 geda.m4
   The `-I .' says to search in the current directory for the `.m4'
files.  The output frozen file is `pcblib'.  The main `common.m4' file
is listed as well as all of the `*.m4' files which define the
components in the library.

   In addition, a library contents file is created during the build with
the `CreateLibraryContents.sh' script.  A typical call to
`CreateLibrary.sh' used during the compilation of PCB is:
     ./CreateLibraryContents.sh -I . ./common.m4 TTL_74xx_DIL.list
     connector.list crystal.list generic.list genericsmt.list gtag.list
     jerry.list linear.list logic.list lsi.list memory.list optical.list
     pci.list resistor_0.25W.list resistor_adjust.list resistor_array.list
     texas_inst_amplifier.list texas_inst_voltage_reg.list transistor.list
     geda.list > pcblib.contents

   The `pcblib.contents' file is used by the PCB program to define the
libraries and components which will be displayed when you bring up the
library window from within PCB.  An example of part of the
`pcblib.contents' file is:
     TYPE=~TTL 74xx DIL
     7400_dil:N:7400:4 dual-NAND
     7401_dil:N:7401:4 dual-NAND OC
     7402_dil:N:7402:4 dual-NOR
     TYPE=~geda
     geda_DIP6:DIP6:DIP6:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_DIP8:DIP8:DIP8:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_DIP14:DIP14:DIP14:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_ACY300:ACY300:ACY300:Axial non-polar component,
   The `TYPE=' lines define the library name that will show up in the
library window in PCB.  The other lines define the actual components in
the library.

9.1.2.2 Scripts Used by PCB at Runtime
......................................

When PCB is first executed, it makes a call to the
`ListLibraryContents.sh' script.  This script provides the PCB program
with the contents of the library contents file created when PCB was
compiled.  A typical call to `ListLibraryContents.sh' is
     ../lib/ListLibraryContents.sh .:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib pcblib
   This command says to search the path
`.:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib' for a file called `pcblib.contents'
(the `.contents' part is added automatically) and display the contents
of the file.  PCB parses this output and generates the library window
entries.

   When you pick a library component from the library window, PCB calls
the `QueryLibrary.sh' script to actually pull the footprint into the
layout.  For example, when the ACY300 component is selected from the
`~geda' library, the generated call may be:

     /tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib/QueryLibrary.sh
     .:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib pcblib geda_ACY300 ACY300
     ACY300
   If you were to run this command by hand you would see the PCB code
for the element:
     Element(0x00 "Axial non-polar component," "" "ACY300" 245 70 0 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pin(0 25 50 20 "1" 0x101)
     	Pin(300 25 50 20 "2" 0x01)

     	ElementLine(0 25 75 25 10)
     	ElementLine(225 25 300 25 10)

     	ElementLine(75 0 225 0 10)
     	ElementLine(225 0 225 50 10)
     	ElementLine(225 50 75 50 10)
     	ElementLine(75 50 75 0 10)

     #       ElementArc(X1 Y 50 50 270 180 10)
     #       ElementArc(X2 Y 50 50 90 180 10)

     	Mark(75 25)
     )

9.1.3 Creating an Oldlib Footprint
----------------------------------

This section provides a complete example of defining a family of
footprints using the M4 style library.  As a vehicle for this example, a
family of footprints for surface mount resistors and capacitors will be
developed.   The file `example.inc' should have been installed on your
system as `$prefix/share/examples/oldlib/example.inc' where `$prefix'
is often times `/usr/local'.

   The `example.inc' file defines a macro called `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT'
which is a generic definition for a surface mount footprint with two
identical, rectangular pads.  This macro will be called with different
parameters to fill out the family of parts.  The arguments to the
`COMMON_PKG_RCSMT' are:
     # -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # the definition for surface mount resistors and capacitors
     # $1: canonical name
     # $2: name on PCB
     # $3: value
     # $4: pad width   (in direction perpendicular to part)
     # $5: pad length  (in direction parallel with part)
     # $6: pad spacing (center to center)
     # $7: distance from edge of pad to silk (in direction
     #     perpendicular to part)
     # $8: distance from edge of pad to silk (in direction parallel
     #     with part)
     # $9: Set to "no" to skip silk screen on the sides of the part

     define(`COMMON_PKG_RCSMT',
     	`define(`XMIN', `eval( -1*`$6'/2 - `$5'/2 - `$8')')
     	define(`XMAX', `eval(  `$6'/2 + `$5'/2 + `$8')')
     	define(`YMIN', `eval(-1*`$4'/2 - `$7')')
     	define(`YMAX', `eval(   `$4'/2 + `$7')')
     Element(0x00 "$1" "$2" "$3" eval(XMIN+20) eval(YMAX+20) 0 100 0x00)
     (
     	ifelse(0, eval($4>$5),
     	# Pads which have the perpendicular pad dimension less
     	# than or equal to the parallel pad dimension
     	Pad(eval(-1*(   $6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0
     	    eval((-1*$6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0 eval($4) "1" 0x100)
     	Pad(eval(-1*(-1*$6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0
     	    eval((   $6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0 eval($4) "2" 0x100)
     	,
     	# Pads which have the perpendicular pad dimension greater
     	# than or equal to the parallel pad dimension
     	Pad(eval(-1*$6/2) eval(-1*($4 - $5)/2)
     	    eval(-1*$6/2)  eval(($4 - $5)/2) eval($5) "1" 0x100)
     	Pad(eval(   $6/2) eval(-1*($4 - $5)/2)
     	    eval(   $6/2)  eval(($4 - $5)/2) eval($5) "2" 0x100)
     	)

     	# silk screen
     	# ends
     	ElementLine(XMIN YMIN XMIN YMAX 10)
     	ElementLine(XMAX YMAX XMAX YMIN 10)
     	# sides
     ifelse($9,"no",
     	#skip side silk
     	,
     	ElementLine(XMIN YMIN XMAX YMIN 10)
     	ElementLine(XMAX YMAX XMIN YMAX 10)
     )
     	Mark(0 0)
     )')
   Note that the part has been defined with the mark located at `(0,0)'
and that the pads have been placed with the mark at the common centroid
of the footprint.  While not a requirement, this is highly desirable
when developing a library that will need to interface with a pick and
place machine used for factory assembly of a board.

   The final part of `example.inc' defines particular versions of the
generic footprint we have created.  These particular versions correspond
to various industry standard package sizes.
     # 0402 package
     #
     # 30x30 mil pad, 15 mil metal-metal spacing=>
     # 15 + 15 + 15 = 45 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC0402',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 30, 30, 45, 0, 10, "no")')

     # 0603 package
     #
     # 40x40 mil pad, 30 mil metal-metal spacing=>
     #  30 + 20 + 20 = 70 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC0603',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 40, 40, 70, 10, 10)')

     # 1206 package
     #
     # 40x60 mil pad, 90 mil metal-metal spacing=>
     #  90 + 20 + 20 = 130 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC1206',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 60, 40, 130, 10, 10)')

   At this point, the `example.inc' file could be used by third party
tools such as `gsch2pcb'.  However to fully integrate our footprints
into PCB we need to create the `example.m4' and `example.list' files.
The `example.m4' file defines descriptions for the new footprints.
     define(`Description_my_RC0402',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0402)'')
     define(`Description_my_RC0603',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0603)'')
     define(`Description_my_RC1206',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (1206)'')
   Finally we need to create the `example.list' file.
     my_RC0402:RC0402:RES0402
     my_RC0402:RC0402:CAP0402
     my_RC0603:RC0603:RES0603
     my_RC0603:RC0603:CAP0603
     my_RC1206:RC1206:RES1206
     my_RC1206:RC1206:CAP1206
   The first field in the list file has the name corresponding to the
Description definitions in `example.m4'.  The second field is the
template name which corresponds to the macros `PKG_*' we defined in
`example.inc' with the leading `PKG_' removed.  It is the second field
which controls what footprint will actually appear on the board.  The
final field is the name of the part type on the board.  The first line
in our `example.list' file will produce a menu entry in the library
window that reads:
     CAP0402, Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0402)
   The `CAP0402' portion comes directly from the third field in
`example.list' and the longer description comes from descriptions
macros in `example.m4'.  Please note that any extra white space at the
end of a line in the `.list' files will cause them to not work properly.

9.1.4 Troubleshooting Old Style Libraries
-----------------------------------------

A powerful technique to help debug problems with libraries is to invoke
the `m4' processor directly.  This approach will provide error output
which is not visible from within PCB.  The following example shows how
one might try to debug an 8 pin small outline (SO8) package.  The macro
name for the package is PKG_SO8.  In this example, the canonical name
that is to be associated with the part is SO8, the reference designator
is U1, and the value is MAX4107 (the part number).

     echo "PKG_SO8(SO8, U1, MAX4107)" | \
        gm4 common.m4 - | \
        awk '/^[ \t]*$/ {next} {print}' | \
        more
   The `awk' call simply removes blank lines which make the output hard
to read.

   For this particular example, the output is:
     Element(0x00 "SO8" "U1" "MAX4107" 146 50 3 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pad(10 25 38 25 20 "1" 0x00)
     	Pad(10 75 38 75 20 "2" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 125 38 125 20 "3" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 175 38 175 20 "4" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 175 242 175 20 "5" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 125 242 125 20 "6" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 75 242 75 20 "7" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 25 242 25 20 "8" 0x100)
     	ElementLine(0 0 151 0 10)
     	ElementArc(126 0 25 25 0 180 10)
     	ElementLine(101 0 252 0 10)
     	ElementLine(252 0 252 200 10)
     	ElementLine(252 200 0 200 10)
     	ElementLine(0 200 0 0 10)
     	Mark(29 25)
     )

9.2 New Style Libraries
=======================

Footprints for the new style library are created graphically using the
PCB program.  A single footprint is saved in each file.

9.2.1 Creating Newlib Footprints
--------------------------------

To create
  1. Start PCB with an empty layout.

  2. Make the component layer active.

  3. For a leaded part, select the via tool and place vias where the
     pads for the part should go.  For surface mount pads, draw line
     segments.  Note that until the footprint is completed, the surface
     mount pads will remain rounded.  Currently a rectangle or polygon
     may not be used as a pad.

  4. For each via and line segment which will become a pad, select it
     and press 'n' to be able to enter a name.  Enter the pin number
     and press enter.

  5. Make the silk layer active.

  6. Using the line and arc tools, draw a silk screen outline for the
     part.

  7. Using the selection tool, select all of the pins and silk screen
     for the part.

  8. Place the pointer above the reference point for the part.  This is
     typically the common centroid.  Keeping the pointer there,
     shift-right-click to bring up the popup menu and choose "convert
     selection to element".

  9. At this point, the vias, line segments, and silk screen will have
     been converted to an element.  To change any of the line segments
     to have square ends rather than round ends, select the pads by
     holding down the shift key and clicking each pad with the center
     mouse button.  Now under the Select menu, "Change square-flag of
     selected objects" section, choose "Pins".

 10. Select the element, shift-right-click to bring up the popup menu,
     and choose "Copy Selection to Buffer".  Now left-click on the
     center of the new element.

 11. Under the buffer menu, choose "save buffer elements to file" to
     save the new footprint to a file.

 12. Press ESC to exit from buffer mode.

9.2.2 Modifying Newlib Footprints
---------------------------------

  1. In the `Pcb' program, instantiate the footprint you wish to modify.

  2. Using the selection tool, select the footprint.

  3. Now left-click on the selected element, this brings up a popup
     menu, choose "Cut to Buffer" from the popup menu.

  4. Under the buffer menu, choose "break buffer element to pieces",
     and then left-click to place the broken apart footprint to an open
     area of the layout.  Note that you must use the items under the
     buffer menu, the items with the same names in the popup menu do
     not work.

  5. Make your desired modifications to the footprint and then convert
     the pieces back to an element using the same procedure as when
     starting from scratch on a new footprint.

10 Schematic Capture for PCB
****************************

When designing a circuit board of any complexity, a schematic capture
front-end for the design is highly desired.  Any schematic capture
program which is able to generate a netlist in a user defined format as
well as a bill of materials can be made to work with PCB.  Currently, we
are aware of two freely available schematic capture programs which can
interface with PCB.  This chapter shows how a design can be taken from
start to finish using either of these two tools for schematic capture
and PCB for layout.

* Menu:

* gEDA::          Interfacing with GNU EDA (gEDA).
* xcircuit::      Interfacing with xcircuit.


File: pcb.info,  Node: gEDA,  Next: xcircuit,  Up: Schematic Frontends

10.1 gEDA
=========

This section shows how to use gEDA as the schematic capture front-end
for a PCB design.  This section is not intended to be complete
documentation on gEDA and it is assumed that the user has at least some
familiarity with the gEDA suite of programs.

   The basic steps in a gEDA + PCB design flow are:
  1. Set up project directories

  2. Set up gEDA (gschem/gnetlist) config files

  3. Set up gsch2pcb config files

  4. Capture schematics using `gschem' (part of gEDA)

  5. Create any unique PCB footprints needed for the design

  6. Generate initial PCB design using `gsch2pcb' (part of gEDA)

  7. Layout circuit board using `pcb'

  8. Make any additional schematic changes with `gschem' and forward
     annotate to PCB with `gsch2pcb'

  9. Generate photoplot files (RS-274X, also known as "Gerber") for
     board vendor

10.1.1 Set Up Project Directories
---------------------------------

Although not required, a typical project directory will contain the
schematics and board layout at the top level.  Schematic symbols and
circuit board footprints which are unique to this project are stored in
subdirectories.  For this example, `sym' contains the project specific
schematic symbols and `pkg' contains the project specific footprints.
Set up the project subdirectory and subdirectories by executing:
     mkdir ~/myproj
     cd ~/myproj
     mkdir sym
     mkdir pkg
     mkdir pkg/newlib
     mkdir pkg/m4

10.1.2 Set Up gEDA Config Files
-------------------------------

The gEDA tools, specifically `gschem' and `gnetlist', use configuration
files to set the search path for symbol libraries in addition to other
user preferences.  Create a file in the top level project directory
called `gschemrc'.  Add the following lines to that file:

     ;; list libraries here.  Order matters as it sets the
     ;; search order
     (component-library "./sym")
   This sets the local search path for the schematic capture program
`gschem'.  Now the netlister, `gnetlist', must also be configured.
This can be done by copying the file `gschemrc' to `gnetlistrc' by
running `cp gschemrc gnetlistrc'.  Alternatively, you can create a soft
link so only a single file needs to be updated if additional symbol
paths are added.  The link is created by running `ln -s gschemrc
gnetlistrc'.

10.1.3 Set Up `gsch2pcb' Config Files
-------------------------------------

The program `gsch2pcb', not to be confused with the older `gschem2pcb'
script, is used to link the schematic to layout.  `gsch2pcb' is
responsible for creating the netlist used to provide connectivity
information to PCB as well creating an initial layout with all
components instantiated in the design.  Forward annotation of schematic
changes to the layout is also done using `gsch2pcb'.  `gsch2pcb' uses a
project file to set up the schematic file names, PCB library locations,
and output file names.  Create a project file called `project' using
the following as an example:

     # List all the schematics to be netlisted
     # and laid out on the pc board.
     schematics      first.sch second.sch third.sch

     # For an output-name of foo, gsch2pcb generates files
     # foo.net, foo.pcb, and foo.new.pcb.  If there is no
     # output-name specified, the file names are derived from
     # the first listed schematic, i.e. first.net, etc.
     output-name  preamp

10.1.4 Capture Schematics Using `gschem'
----------------------------------------

This section is fairly brief and assumes familiarity with using the
`gschem' schematic capture program.  As you are creating your
schematics, be sure to observe the following rules:
   * Make sure that each component in the schematic has a `footprint'
     attribute that corresponds to a footprint in the PCB library or a
     footprint you plan on creating.

   * Make sure all reference designators are unique.  One way to ensure
     this is to run the `refdes_renum' script (part of gEDA) after the
     schematics are created.

10.1.5 Create Any Unique PCB Footprints
---------------------------------------

Create the new footprints you design needs using either the m4 style or
newlib style of PCB libraries.  Refer to *note Library Creation:: for
details on this process.  For m4 style footprints, store them in the
`pkg/m4' subdirectory and for newlib footprints, store them in the
`pkg/newlib' subdirectory.

10.1.6 Generate Initial PCB Design Using `gsch2pcb'
---------------------------------------------------

The `gsch2pcb' program connects the schematic and layout.  It basic
operation is to call `gnetlist' to generate the connectivity netlist
that PCB used to verify connectivity and to instantiate all elements
found in the schematic to a new layout.  The default, as of `gsch2pcb'
version 0.9,  is to use any found  m4 style parts first and then search
for newlib style if no old style part was found.  By using the
`--use-files' or `-f' flag to `gsch2pcb' priority is given to newlib
style parts even if m4 style are found.  You may wish to verify this in
the `gsch2pcb' documentation in case this changes in the future.  To
start your layout, run `gsch2pcb project' where `project' is the
project file created previously.  This will create a new netlist file,
`preamp.net', and a new layout file, `preamp.pcb'.

10.1.7 Layout Circuit Board
---------------------------

Run PCB on the new layout by running `pcb preamp.pcb'.  Load the
netlist file by selecting "load netlist file" from the "file" menu.  In
the file selection dialog box, choose `preamp.net'.  This loads
connectivity information into PCB.

   Using the selection tool, grab and move apart the various footprints
with the middle mouse button.  Once the parts are moved apart from each
other, choose "optimize rats-nest" from the "Connects" menu.  This menu
choice will display and optimize the rats nest.  Use the rats nest to
help guide placement of the parts.  You may wish to re-run the "optimize
rats-nest" command after moving parts around.

   After the placement is complete, use the line tool to add traces to
the board.  As traces are added, the corresponding rats line will
disappear.

10.1.8 Forward Annotation of Schematic Changes
----------------------------------------------

If schematic changes are made after the layout has started, `gsch2pcb'
can be used to forward annotate these changes to the layout.  To
forward annotate schematic changes, run `gsch2pcb project'.  This
command will create the files `preamp.new.pcb', `preamp.net', and
modify the file `preamp.pcb'.  The modifications to `preamp.pcb'
include forward annotation of schematic component value changes, adds
any new components, and removes any deleted components.

10.1.9 Generate Photoplot Files (RS-274X)
-----------------------------------------

After the layout is complete, choose "edit layer-groupings" from the
"Settings" menu.  The LayerGroups form lets you specify which layers
will appear in each output layer group.  For example, in the default
form, layer group 1 has "front" and "front side" in it.  The output
file `1.gbr' if DOS file names are used, or `somename_front.gbr' if
long file names are used will contain the "front" and "front side"
layers in it.  Usually the defaults are sufficient, but this form is
still a useful reference.

   Choose "print layout..." from the "File" menu.  In the print dialog
box, select "Gerber/RS-274X" for the device driver.  Select the
"outline", "alignment", and "drillhelper" options.  To get DOS
compatible file names, select the "DOS (8.3) names" option, otherwise
enter "preamp" for the filename.  Press "OK".

   The following output files should have been created in the project
directory.  The names in parentheses correspond to the DOS compatible
output file names.
`preamp_frontsilk.gbr (csilk.gbr)'
     Top side silk screen.

`preamp_frontmask.gbr (cmask.gbr)'
     Top side soldermask relief.

`preamp_front.gbr (1.gbr)'
     Top copper.

`preamp_backmask.gbr (smask.gbr)'
     Bottom side soldermask relief.

`preamp_back.gbr (2.gbr)'
     Bottom Copper.

`preamp_fab.gbr (fab.gbr)'
     Fabrication drawing.  Also known as the drill drawing.  This
     drawing is used for reference by the board vendor but is not
     directly used in the fabrication process.

`preamp_plated-drill.cnc (pdrill.cnc)'
     NC Drill format file for the plated through holes.

`preamp_unplated-drill.cnc (udrill.cnc)'
     NC Drill format file for the unplated through holes.

`preamp_bom.txt (bom.txt)'
     A bill of materials for the layout.

`preamp_xy.txt (xy.txt)'
     Centroid (X-Y) data for driving automated assembly equipment.

Appendix A Installation and Troubleshooting
*******************************************

Compiling and installing the package should be straightforward. If any
problems occur, please contact the author <Thomas.Nau@rz.uni-ulm.de>,
or the current maintainer <haceaton@aplcomm.jhuapl.edu> to find a
solution and include it into the next release.

* Menu:

* compiling::     Compiling and installing.
* problems::      Troubleshooting.

A.1 Compiling and Installing
============================

This section covers the steps which are necessary to compile the
package.

* Menu:

* quickstart::                 Quick start.
* running configure::          Customizing Pcb with Configure


File: pcb.info,  Node: quickstart,  Next: running configure,  Up: compiling

A.1.1 Quick Start
-----------------

Starting with version 2.0, `Pcb' has switched to a GNU
autoconf/automake build system.  Installation of `Pcb' consists of
three steps:  configuration, building, and installing.  In a typical
installation, these steps are as simple as
     ./configure
     make
     make install


File: pcb.info,  Node: running configure,  Prev: quickstart,  Up: compiling

A.1.2 Running the configure Script
----------------------------------

The `configure' script accepts all of the standard GNU configure
options.  For a complete list of configuration options, run
`./configure --help'.

`INFOLIBDIR'
     must be set to the directory where your GNU info files are located.

`PCBLIBDIR'
     is the path of a directory where the font files will be installed.

`DEFAULTFONT'
     the name of the default font file.

`DEFAULTLIBRARY'
     the name of the default library.

`GNUM4'
     the name of GNUs m4 version.

`BTNMOD'
     If your window manager has already bound _Mod1_ together with some
     function keys you may want to change this setting. This is true
     for HP-VUE.


   If you find things which must be changed to compile on your system,
please add the appropriate autoconf tests (if you are familiar with
that) and mail a copy to the maintainer, harry eaton,  at
<haceaton@aplcomm.jhuapl.edu>.

   If you do not have the appropriate permissions you should run
`./pcbtest.sh' in the `src' directory to run `Pcb' from the
installation directory.

A.2 Troubleshooting
===================

There are some known problems. Most of them are related to missing
parts of a standard `X11' distribution. Some others are caused by third
party applications such as `X' servers. To make this list more complete
please mail your problems and, if available, solutions to the author.
The mail address may be found at the beginning of this chapter.  In any
case, read *note X11::.

   By the way, you `MUST HAVE AN ANSI COMPILER' to make `Pcb' work.

   Another source of problems are older versions of `flex' and `bison'.
`Pcb' definitely works with `flex-2.4.7' and `bison-1.22' or later. The
problems will result in a _syntax error_ while parsing files.  This
should only be a problem if you have modified the `flex' or `bison'
input files.

   The following list gives you just an idea because I'm not able to
test all `Pcb' releases on all platforms.

* Menu:

* HP::              Hewlett-Packard series 700 and 800 running HP-UX 10.*

A.2.1 HP Series 700 and 800
---------------------------

You have to install several `X11' include files or, better, install a
complete `X11R5' release. Hewlett-Packard doesn't support the Athena
Widgets. So the header files and libraries are missing from the
application media, but they are available as a patch.  They also do not
ship the `ANSI' compiler with the normal operating system release so
you have to buy one or use `GCC'.  Some of the tools are available as
patches.

   In addition, `Pcb' has been successfully tested on these platforms
with `HPUX 9.*, 10.*' running self-compiled `X11R5'.

instead of `OpenWindows'. `Pcb' compiled successfully with all kinds of
SPARCstations `Solaris-2.[345]'.

A.2.8 Problems related to X11
-----------------------------

There are a some problems related to `X11R4' or systems derived from
`X11' such as `OpenWindows'. *Note Sun::. You at least have to change
all occurances of _baseTranslations_ in the resource files to
_translations_ if you are using a `X11R4' server. Look at the `X11R5'
_Intrinsics_ manual for details.

   The panner widget (print dialog box) appears only in release `X11R5'
and later. It really simplifies adjusting the offsets.  With earlier
releases the printout will always appear in the center of the page.

   You may have some problems in a mixed `X11-OpenWindows' environment.

Appendix B Customizing the Menus
********************************

The menu system is driven off a data file that contains "resources".  A
resource is a hierarchical description of a data tree which, in this
case, is mapped to the hierarchical menus used by Pcb.

* Menu:

* Resource Syntax::          What a resource file looks like.
* Menu Definitions::         Using a resource to define a menu.
* Menu Files and Defaults::  Where Pcb looks for its menu resource.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Resource Syntax,  Next: Menu Definitions,  Up: Custom Menus

B.1 Resource Syntax
===================

A resource file is a simple text file.  It contains curly braces to
group things, spaces between things, and double quotes when strings
need to include spaces.  There are four fundamental ways of adding data
to a resource.

   First, a string (either a single word or a quoted string with spaces,
we call both "strings" in this appendix) can be added all by itself, to
add a string resource to the current resource.  This is used, for
example, to define the string printed on a menu button.  In this
example, four strings are added to the FILE resource:

     File = {
       Sample
       "longer sample"
       some text
     }

   Second, a named string may be added by giving two strings separated
by an equals sign.  This is used to specify X resources and a few other
optional parameters of menus, for example.  Note that a string all by
itself is thus an "unnamed" string.

     {"Layer groups" foreground=red sensitive=false}

   Third, an unnamed subresource may be added.  This is used to create
submenus and menu buttons.  To add a subresource, simply group other
things in curly braces.  This example describes a resource containing
one string and three subresources:

     {File
       {New do_new()}
       {Save do_save()}
       {Quit do_quit()}
     }

   Lastly, a named subresource may be added by prefixing an unnamed
subresource with a string and an equals sign, just as when naming
strings.  This syntax is used to name the resources used for the main
menu and popup menus:

     MainMenu = {
       ...
       }

   Additionally, the menu parser allows for "hooks" whereby portions of
the menu system can be programmatically created at runtime by the
application.  These hooks are invoked by a single word proceeded by an
at sign, such as this example where most of the Sizes menu is created
automatically:

     {Sizes
         @sizes
         {"Adjust active sizes ..." AdjustStyle(0)}
         }

   In addition to all that, any unquoted pound sign (`#') begins a
comment.  Commented text continues until the end of the containing
line.  Comments may begin at the beginning of a line, or after other
text on the line:

     # This is a comment
     MainMenu = { # This is also a comment


File: pcb.info,  Node: Menu Definitions,  Next: Menu Files and Defaults,  Prev: Resource Syntax,  Up: Custom Menus

B.2 Menu Definitions
====================

To best understand this section, you should find the `pcb-menu.res'
file that your Pcb uses and refer to it for examples (*note Menu Files
and Defaults::).  Note that the lesstif GUI uses `pcb-menu.res' and the
GTK+ GUI uses `gpcb-menu.res'.  The file format is identical however
and if so desired, one can make one file be a soft link to the other.

   A resource defines a menu when it meets certain semantic
requirements.  The menu hierarchy is reflected as a hierarchy of unnamed
subresources, with the first string of each subresource defining the
label used for the menu button.  A subresource that itself contains
subresources becomes a submenu, a subresource that does not becomes a
button.

   A submenu should only contain subresources for the buttons or
submenus within that submenu.  Two exceptions are allowed: an initial
string sets the label, and the string "-" (a single dash) will create a
separator.

   A button should not contain subresources, but will contain many
strings, named and unnamed.  The first member shall be an unnamed
string which is the label for the button.  Any other unnamed strings
within the button's resource will be used as actions (much like the
.Xdefaults action strings), which are functions that will be called
when the button is pressed (or popped up, or created, depending on the
action).  As a convenience, if a left parenthesis is seen, the current
"word" will continue at least until the matching right parenthesis.
This allows you to pass strings with spaces as arguments to actions
without needing to quote the action.

   Named resources in button resources will be used as X resources.
Such resources can be used to set the font, color, and spacing of
buttons.  As a convenience, "fg" can be used as an abbreviation for
"foreground".

   Within the menu's resource file, Pcb will look for a few key named
subresources.  At the moment, there are just two key named subresources.
`MainMenu' will be used for the main menu bar and `Mouse' will be used
to define mouse actions.  In the future, other named subresources will
be used for popup resources.

   Given all this, a small sample `pcb-menu.res' would be:

     MainMenu = {
       {File
         {"Open..." Load(Layout)}
         -
         {"Quit" Quit() fg=red font=10x20}
       }
     }

   Within the Pcb sources are specially crafted comments that mark all
the actions, flags, menu hooks, and whatnot that Pcb offers.  Read the
file `src/gather-actions' in the Pcb source tree for documentation for
these comments.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Menu Files and Defaults,  Prev: Menu Definitions,  Up: Custom Menus

B.3 Menu Files and Defaults
===========================

Pcb will look for a file which defines its menus, trying the following
names (the example is for the lesstif GUI, the GTK+ GUI has
"gpcb-menu.res" in place of "pcb-menu.res"):

     ./pcb-menu.res
     $HOME/.pcb-menu.res
     $PCBLIBDIR/pcb-menu.res
     <internal>

   Note that PCBLIBDIR defaults to `/usr/local/share/pcb' (hence,
`/usr/local/share/pcb/pcb-menu.res').  The `<internal>' entry refers to
a menu definition within the Pcb application itself.  The master file
for all this is the file `src/pcb-menu.res' in the Pcb source tree.
This master source is used to create the internal menu definition as
well as being installed in `$pcblibdir'.

Appendix C Element Search/Regular Expressions
*********************************************

C.1 Element Search/Regular Expressions
======================================

`Pcb''s search is based on POSIX 1003.2 Regular Expressions.  Full POSIX
Regular Expressions are supported by `Pcb' if the regex library was
available when `Pcb' was built.  One difference from the regular
expressions found in tools like awk or grep is that PCB implicitly adds
a "^" to the begining of a regular expression and "$" to the end of the
regular expression.  For example, if you enter "C1", the actual regular
expression used internally is "^C1$".  Another difference is that
search patterns in pcb are not case sensitive. That is, "CON" is
treated the same as "con".

   It is easier to show by example how to search than explain POSIX
1003.2.  With regular expressions most characters are just themselves,
but some are special:

`*'
     Matches 0 or more instances of preceding character.

`+'
     Matches 1 or more instances of preceding character.

`?'
     Matches 0 or 1 instances of preceding character.

`.'
     Matches any single character other than the newline character.

`|'
     The vertical bar is the alternation operator. It combines two
     regular expressions. The result matches if either of them matches.

`\'
     A backslash indicates the next character should not be interpreted
     literally if it normally is, and should be interpreted literally
     if it normally isn't.

`{n}'
     An integer n enclosed in curly brackets matches the preceding item
     if it occurs exactly n times.

`[ ]'
     A pair of square brackets matches every character they contain.
     Characters may be given explicitly, or as ranges.

`-'
     A hyphen in the context of square brackets denotes the range
     between the preceding and the following character.  E.g., the
     range of digits is "0-9" .  The range of letters from C to K is
     "C-K" .

`\^ inside square brackets'
     Inside square brackets the caret is an anti operator. Its presence
     makes the square prackets match anything except the contents of
     the brackets.

`( )'
     Round parenthesis group parts of a regular expression. This is
     very much like they do in math formulars.


   If you need a special character literally, you can escape it with a
backslash.

   The following examples illustrate how regular expressions can be
used to specify element names (reference designators) to search for.
`C5'
     Select the element whose name is exactly "C5".

`C5 | R3'
     Select C5 and R3.

`C.*'
     Select all elements whose name start with the letter "C", such as
     C5, or C42, or CF1.

`C.*1'
     Select all elements that start with "C" and end with "1", such as
     C1, or C51 or C5/9B71.

`R10?'
     Search for R1 or R10, but will not select R100 or R105. The
     question mark is a quantifier for the character "0".

`R128+'
     Selects R128, R1288, R12888, etc.

`TB.'
     Select all terminal blocks having exactly one character designator
     after "TB" such as TB1, TBA, or TBx but not TB.

`TB..'
     Select all terminal blocks having a two character designator such
     as TB21 or TB1a.

`TB.*'
     Select all terminal blocks with any designator.

`.*31'
     Select all items, whose name ends with "31" such as Q31, or R31,
     or R531.

`Q[12]'
     Select Q1 and Q2.

`[A-D].*'
     Select all items, whose name starts with "A", "B", "C", or "D".

`.*N{2}.*'
     Select all items, whose name contains two "N" in a row such as
     CONN23, or connA, but not CON5

`[^D].*'
     Select all items that do not start with the letter "D", such as
     C2, or R34, but not D34

Appendix E Centroid (X-Y) File Format
*************************************

E.1 Overview
============

E.2 File Format
===============

The centroid output file is in a standard comma seperated values (CSV)
format.  Comment lines begin with a "#".  The output file contains a
header with a version number for the file format, some comments
containing the author and title of the board, and a comment describing
the remainder of the file format.

   An example centroid file is shown below.

     C13,"0402","0.01u",2340.00,3014.00,270,top

E.3 Computation of Centroid and Rotation
========================================

The center of each element is found by averaging the (X,Y) coordinates
for the center of each pin and pad in the element.  For example if an
element has 2 pins, 1 at (1,0) and another at (1,4) then the centroid
will be at (1,2).

   The calculation of rotation is a bit more complex.  Currently a
rotation is not stored for each element but rather the rotated element
is stored.  In other words if the element from the library has a pin at
(0,0) and (0,2) and it has been rotated by 90 degrees, then the `.pcb'
file will store (0,0) and (2,0) for the pin locations with no
indication that they have been rotated from the original.

   In the event that the element has only 1 pin, then the rotation is
set to zero.  If the element has only one pad (as opposed to a
through-hole pin), then the rotation of the pad is used.

   When the element has multiple pins, the location of pin #1 is placed
in the coordinate system which has the centroid of the part at (0,0).
Then which quadrant pin #1 falls in determines the rotation.  Zero
degrees of rotation is defined as pin #1 being in the upper left
quadrant.  Increasing angles correspond to counterclockwise rotation so
a rotation of 90 degrees places pin #1 in the lower left quadrant.
Currently, the only allowed rotations are 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

   If pin #1 happens to be at the centroid of the part, then pin #2 is
examined to see which quadrant it is located in.  The same rules apply
for the definitions of rotation.  In other words, when pin #1 is at the
centroid of the part and pin #2 is in the upper left quadrant, the
rotation is declared to be zero degrees.

Appendix F Annotation File Format
*********************************

F.1 Overview
============

F.2 File Format
===============

The annotation output file an ASCII file that can be used to communicate
layout changes that affect the netlist back to a schematic tool.
Currently the only place this file is used is if when the Renumber()
action is called within Pcb.  Renumber() will renumber all the
reference designators (instance names) in the layout.  The result of
the renumbering will be written out to an annotation file which can be
used to propagate the changes to the schematic sources.  See *note
Renumber Action:: for details on the Renumber() action.  If you are
using gschem (part of gEDA/gaf) as your schematic entry tool then refer
to pcb_backannotate(1) for details on how to use the annotation file to
make the changes to the schematics.

   The annotation file format is fairly simple.  Each line consists of
a command followed by arguments.  Blank lines and lines consisting of
only whitespace are ignored.  There are no line continuations.

   An example annotation file is shown below.

     *COMMENT* PCB Annotation File
     *FILEVERSION* 20061031
     *RENAME* "C17" "C1"
     *RENAME* "U5" "U1"
     *RENAME* "U6" "U2"
     *RENAME* "C21" "C2"
     *RENAME* "R14" "R1"
     *RENAME* "C7" "C3"
     *RENAME* "C8" "C4"
     *RENAME* "C6" "C5"

F.2.1 *COMMENT*
---------------

Command for a comment.  The text of a comment is ignored by tools which
process the annotation file.
*COMMENT* text

F.2.2 *FILEVERSION*
-------------------

Indicates what version of the annotation file is in use.  The date code
corresponds to the date when the current version was added to the Pcb
sources.
*FILEVERSION* datecode

F.2.3 *RENAME*
--------------

Renames an element.  The arguments are enclosed in double quotes and
are the original name and the new name.
*RENAME* "old" "new"

Appendix G Action Reference
***************************

Many actions take a `delta' parameter as the last parameter, which is
an amount to change something.  That `delta' may include units, as an
additional parameter, such as `Action(Object,5,mm)'.  If no units are
specified, the default is PCB's native units (currently 1/100 mil).
Also, if the delta is prefixed by `+' or `-', the size is increased or
decreased by that amount.  Otherwise, the size size is set to the given
amount.

     Action(Object,5,mil)
     Action(Object,+0.5,mm)
     Action(Object,-1)

   Actions which take a `delta' parameter which do not accept all these
options will specify what they do take.

   Many actions act on indicated objects on the board.  They will have
parameters like `ToggleObject' or `SelectedVias' to indicate what group
of objects they act on.  Unless otherwise specified, these parameters
are defined as follows:

`Object'
`ToggleObject'
     Affects the object under the mouse pointer.  If this action is
     invoked from a menu or script, the user will be prompted to click
     on an object, which is then the object affected.

`Selected'
`SelectedObjects'
     Affects all objects which are currently selected.  At least, all
     selected objects for which the given action makes sense.

`SelectedPins'
`SelectedVias'
`SelectedTYPE'
`etc'
     Affects all objects which are both selected and of the TYPE
     specified.

G.1.1 AddRats
-------------

AddRats(AllRats|SelectedRats|Close)

Add one or more rat lines to the board.

`AllRats'
     Create rat lines for all loaded nets that aren't already connected
     on with copper.

`SelectedRats'
     Similarly, but only add rat lines for nets connected to selected
     pins and pads.

`Close'
     Selects the shortest unselected rat on the board.

G.1.2 ApplyVendor
-----------------

ApplyVendor()

Applies the currently loaded vendor drill table to the current design.  

   This will modify all of your drill holes to match the list of allowed
sizes for your vendor.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Atomic Action,  Next: Attributes Action,  Prev: ApplyVendor Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.3 Atomic
------------

Atomic(Save|Restore|Close|Block)

Save or restore the undo serial number.

   This action allows making multiple-action bindings into an atomic
operation that will be undone by a single Undo command.  For example,
to optimize rat lines, you'd delete the rats and re-add them.  To group
these into a single undo, you'd want the deletions and the additions to
have the same undo serial number.  So, you `Save', delete the rats,
`Restore', add the rats - using the same serial number as the deletes,
then `Block', which checks to see if the deletions or additions
actually did anything.  If not, the serial number is set to the saved
number, as there's nothing to undo.  If something did happen, the
serial number is incremented so that these actions are counted as a
single undo step.

`Save'
     Saves the undo serial number.

`Restore'
     Returns it to the last saved number.

`Close'
     Sets it to 1 greater than the last save.

`Block'
     Does a Restore if there was nothing to undo, else does a Close.

the pcb, an element, or a layer.


File: pcb.info,  Node: AutoPlaceSelected Action,  Next: AutoRoute Action,  Prev: Attributes Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.5 AutoPlaceSelected
-----------------------

AutoPlaceSelected()

Auto-place selected components.

   Attempts to re-arrange the selected components such that the nets
connecting them are minimized.  Note that you cannot undo this.


File: pcb.info,  Node: AutoRoute Action,  Next: ChangeClearSize Action,  Prev: AutoPlaceSelected Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.6 AutoRoute
---------------

AutoRoute(AllRats|SelectedRats)

Auto-route some or all rat lines.

`AllRats'
     Attempt to autoroute all rats.

`SelectedRats'
     Attempt to autoroute the selected rats.


   Before autorouting, it's important to set up a few things.  First,
make sure any layers you aren't using are disabled, else the autorouter
may use them.  Next, make sure the current line and via styles are set
accordingly.  Last, make sure "new lines clear polygons" is set, in
case you eventually want to add a copper pour.

   Autorouting takes a while.  During this time, the program may not be
responsive.

ChangeFlag(SelectedPads|SelectedTexts|SelectedNames, flag, value)
ChangeFlag(SelectedElements, flag, value)
flag = square | octagon | thermal | join
value = 0 | 1

Sets or clears flags on objects.

   Toggles the given flag on the indicated object(s).  The flag may be
one of the flags listed above (square, octagon, thermal, join).  The
value may be the number 0 or 1.  If the value is 0, the flag is
cleared.  If the value is 1, the flag is set.

G.1.10 ChangeHole
-----------------

ChangeHole(ToggleObject|Object|SelectedVias|Selected)

plated-through hole (not set), or an unplated hole (set).


File: pcb.info,  Node: ChangeJoin Action,  Next: ChangeName Action,  Prev: ChangeHole Action,  Up: core actions

G.1.11 ChangeJoin
-----------------

ChangeJoin(ToggleObject|SelectedLines|SelectedArcs|Selected)

Changes the join (clearance through polygons) of objects.

   The join flag determines whether a line or arc, drawn to intersect a
polygon, electrically connects to the polygon or not.  When joined, the
line/arc is simply drawn over the polygon, making an electrical
connection.  When not joined, a gap is drawn between the line and the
polygon, insulating them from each other.

G.1.12 ChangeName
-----------------

ChangeName(Object)
ChangeName(Layout|Layer)

Sets the name of objects.

`Object'
     Changes the name of the element under the cursor.

`Layout'
     Changes the name of the layout.  This is printed on the fab
     drawings.

`Layer'
     Changes the name of the currently active layer.

G.1.13 ChangeOctagon
--------------------

ChangeOctagon(Object|ToggleObject|SelectedObjects|Selected)
ChangeOctagon(SelectedElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias)

Changes the octagon-flag of pins and vias.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.

G.1.14 ChangePaste
------------------

ChangePaste(ToggleObject|Object|SelectedPads|Selected)

Changes the no paste flag of objects.

   The "no paste flag" of a pad determines whether the solderpaste
stencil will have an opening for the pad (no set) or if there wil be
no solderpaste on the pad (set).  This is used for things such as
fiducial pads.

G.1.15 ChangePinName
--------------------

ChangePinName(ElementName,PinNumber,PinName)

Sets the name of a specific pin on a specific element.

   This can be especially useful for annotating pin names from a
schematic to the layout without requiring knowledge of the pcb file
format.

ChangeSize(SelectedElements, delta)

Changes the size of objects.

   For lines and arcs, this changes the width.  For pins and vias, this
changes the overall diameter of the copper annulus.  For pads, this
changes the width and, indirectly, the length.  For texts and names,
this changes the scaling factor.  For elements, this changes the width
of the silk layer lines and arcs for this element.

G.1.17 ChangeSquare
-------------------

ChangeSquare(ToggleObject)
ChangeSquare(SelectedElements|SelectedPins)
ChangeSquare(Selected|SelectedObjects)

Changes the square flag of pins and pads.

   Note that `Pins' means both pins and pads.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.

G.1.18 ClearOctagon
-------------------

ClearOctagon(ToggleObject|Object|SelectedObjects|Selected)
ClearOctagon(SelectedElements|SelectedPins|SelectedVias)

Clears the octagon-flag of pins and vias.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.

G.1.21 Connection
-----------------

Connection(Find|ResetLinesAndPolygons|ResetPinsAndVias|Reset)

Searches connections of the object at the cursor position.

   Connections found with this action will be highlighted in the
"connected-color" color and will have the "found" flag set.

`Find'
     The net under the cursor is "found".

`ResetLinesAndPolygons'
     Any "found" lines and polygons are marked "not found".

`ResetPinsAndVias'
     Any "found" pins and vias are marked "not found".

`Reset'
     All "found" objects are marked "not found".

--------------------

DisableVendor()

Disables automatic drill size mapping.

   When drill mapping is enabled, new instances of pins and vias will
have their drill holes mapped to one of the allowed drill sizes
specified in the currently loaded vendor drill table.

G.1.25 DisperseElements
-----------------------

DisperseElements(All|Selected)

Disperses elements.

   Normally this is used when starting a board, by selecting all
elements and then dispersing them.  This scatters the elements around
the board so that you can pick individual ones, rather than have all the
elements at the same 0,0 coordinate and thus impossible to choose from.
