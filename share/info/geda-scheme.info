About gEDA
==========

"gEDA", or _GPL Electronic Design Automation_, is a suite of free
software tools for designing electronics.  The gEDA project has
produced and continues working on a full GPL'd suite and toolkit of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. These tools are used for
electrical circuit design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping,
and production. Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of
free software applications for electronics design, including schematic
capture, attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation,
netlisting into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation,
and printed circuit board (PCB) layout.

   The gEDA project was started because of the lack of free EDA tools
for POSIX systems with the primary purpose of advancing the state of
free hardware or open source hardware. The suite is mainly being
developed on the GNU/Linux platform with some development effort going
into making sure the tools run on other platforms as well.

About the gEDA Scheme API
=========================

The "gEDA Scheme API", documented in this manual, is a set of Scheme
functions which can be used to enhance gEDA applications by adding new
functionality or modify existing behaviour.

   gEDA has always used a Scheme interpreter for interpreting
configuration files, managing keybindings in gschem, and implementing
netlist exporter backends in gnetlist.  However, for a long time the
utility of embedding a Scheme interpreter was diminished by the lack of
a low-level API for inspecting and modifying schematic documents.  The
Scheme types and functions documented here were added to gEDA to
address that need.

   gEDA uses the _Guile_ Scheme implementation (otherwise known as the
_GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions_) as its embedded
Scheme.  For more information about Guile, please visit
`http://www.gnu.org/s/guile/'.

1 The Schematic Document Model
******************************

When using gEDA to design an electronic circuit, users use the
schematic editor, gschem, to choose and place _schematic symbols_ on a
_schematic page_, and connect the _pins_ of the symbols together by
drawing _nets_.  The user may add various _attributes_ to symbols, nets
or pins to modify how the circuit diagrams should be interpreted.  The
resulting schematics are then processed with the gnetlist tool to
generate a _netlist_.

   This chapter describes the different data types used by the Scheme
API to represent gEDA documents (both schematics and symbols), and how
they relate to each other.

* Objects::
* Component objects::
* Attributes::
* Coordinate system::


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Pages,  Next: Objects,  Up: Schematic Document Model

1.1 Pages
=========

Schematics and symbols are presented as different types of document to
the user, with different file extensions, icons and mime-types.
However, when they are loaded into a gEDA application such as gschem
for editing, they are internally represented in exactly the same way,
by the `page' type.  The `page' is the top-level gEDA document data
type.

   Internally, the main difference between a `page' for a schematic and
a `page' for a symbol is the types of schematic element they are
permitted to contain (*note Objects::).  For example, a symbol is not
permitted to contain nets, buses, or instances of other symbols, and a
schematic is not permitted to contain pins.

   *Note*: Although the restrictions on what types of primitive element
schematics and symbols may contain are not enforced by the API, designs
which violate these restrictions may cause the netlister not to work as
expected.

   Each `page' is associated with a filename, although the filename is
not required by the API either to be valid or to be associated with a
accessible file in the filesystem.

   Pages are not garbage-collected; once you create a `page', you are
responsible for making sure that it is disposed of when it is no longer
required.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Objects,  Next: Component objects,  Prev: Pages,  Up: Schematic Document Model

1.2 Objects
===========

Each `page' contains some number of "schematic elements", represented
by the `object' type.  There are several sub-types of `object',
including:

   * graphical lines, circles, arcs, rectangles and paths;

   * nets and net pins;

   * buses and bus pins;

   * pictures;

   * text;

   * and symbol instances, known as 'components'.

   Each `object' can be part of at most a single `page' - they cannot
be shared between pages.  `object's are automatically garbage collected.

   Most of different `object' sub-types are quite straightforward to
understand.  The main exceptions are components, and the text
`object'-based attribute mechanism, which are described in the
following sections.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Component objects,  Next: Attributes,  Prev: Objects,  Up: Schematic Document Model

1.3 Component objects
=====================

When a symbol is instantiated in a schematic (e.g. by the user
selecting it from the gschem component library and placing it on the
page), a compound `object' known as a "component" is created.

   Like a `page', a component contains some number of `object'
elements.  When a component is created from a symbol, the contents of
the symbol's `page' are copied into the component.

   In order to allow the component to appear in the correct place on the
schematic page, at the correct orientation, etc., a transformation is
applied to every `object' in the component.

   Normally, when the schematic `page' is closed, the parameters of the
transformation are stored in the schematic file along with the basename
of the original symbol, but the `object' contents of the component are
discarded.  When the schematic is subsequently re-opened, the original
symbol is retrieved from the component library, and used to recreate
the component.

   However, a component may optionally be _embedded_.  In this case,
its contents _are_ stored in the schematic file.

   *Note*: A component cannot contain another component - only other
types of `object'.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Attributes,  Next: Coordinate system,  Prev: Component objects,  Up: Schematic Document Model

1.4 Attributes
==============

A gEDA user is able to annotate schematic elements with additional
data, such as footprints for components or net names for nets.  This is
carried out using "attributes".

   An attribute is text `object' which contains a text string in the
form `NAME=VALUE'.  Currently, the restrictions on attribute format
that are enforced by the API are:

   * Attribute NAMEs:

       1. must contain at least one character;

       2. must not contain a `=' character (Unicode `U+003D');

       3. must not end with a space (` ', Unicode `U+0020').

   * Attribute VALUEs:

       1. must contain at least one character;

       2. must not begin with a space (` ', Unicode `U+0020').

   *Note*: Due to assumptions made by some gEDA tools, it is _strongly
recommended_ that you use attribute NAMEs which contain only lower-case
Latin characters, decimal digits, full stops `.'  (`U+002E'), and
hyphens `-' (`U+002D').

   There are two types of attribute:

   _Attached attributes_ are attribute text `object's that are linked
to another `object'.  To attach an attribute to another schematic
element, both `object's must be part of the same component or part of
the same `object'.  For example, a `netname=NAME' attribute attached to
a net `object' can be used to give that net a specific name in netlist
output, such as `VCC' or `GND'.

   _Floating attributes_ are attribute text `object's that are not
linked to another `object'.  These attributes affect the schematic or
symbol that they're part of as a whole.  For example, a floating
`documentation=URL' attribute in a symbol tells gschem's *Help →
Component Documentation* command how to find the component's data sheet.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Coordinate system,  Prev: Attributes,  Up: Schematic Document Model

1.5 Coordinate system
=====================

gEDA documents use a "coordinate system" (internally referred to as
`world' coordinates) with coordinates increasing upwards and to the
right (i.e. a conventional right-handed Cartesian coordinate system).

   Although all coordinates may be positive or negative, gschem only
displays objects with positive coordinates (i.e. in the upper right
quadrant of the coordinate system).  It is therefore recommended to use
only positive coordinates.

   In the Scheme API, the coordinate of a point is expressed in the
format:

     (x . y)

   and a set of "bounds" (i.e. a rectangular area in the document
plane) is expressed in the format:

     ((left . top) . (right . bottom))

   where `left' is the smaller x coordinate, `right' is the larger x
coordinate, and `bottom' and `top' are respectively the smaller and
larger y coordinates.

2 Core API Reference
********************

The Scheme modules and functions described in this chapter are
primitive operations for working with schematics and symbols, and are
available to be used in all gEDA applications.

* Menu:

* Core page functions::
* Core object functions::
* Core attribute functions::
* Configuration functions::
* System information::


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Core page functions,  Next: Core object functions,  Up: Core API Reference

2.1 Core page functions
=======================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(geda page)' module.

   *Note Pages::.

 -- Function: page? obj
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJ is a `page'.

 -- Function: active-pages
     Returns a list of all open `page's.

2.1.1 Page creation, disposal and filenames
-------------------------------------------

Every `page' is associated with a _filename_.  The filename does not
necessarily have to be a file which exists and/or is accessible in the
filesystem.

 -- Function: make-page filename
     Creates and returns a new, empty `page', with the given string
     FILENAME.

 -- Function: close-page! page
     Destroys PAGE.  The returned value is undefined.

     *Warning*: This function closes and destroys PAGE immediately,
     regardless of whether the page has been modified since loading or
     saving, and without asking the user.

 -- Function: page-filename page
     Returns the filename associated with PAGE as a string.

 -- Function: set-page-filename! page filename
     Sets the filename of PAGE to FILENAME.  Returns PAGE.

2.1.2 Page serialisation
------------------------

Pages can be converted to and from strings in the gEDA schematic file
format.

 -- Function: string->page filename string
     Parses STRING, which should be in the gEDA file format, to create
     a new `page'.  The initial filename for the new `page' is FILENAME.

     If the string is not in gEDA format, raises an `string-format'
     error.

 -- Function: page->string page
     Returns a string representation of PAGE in the gEDA file format.

2.1.3 Page contents
-------------------

A schematic or symbol `page' is composed of a set of `object's which
determine both its graphical appearance and its electrical meaning.

 -- Function: page-contents page
     Returns a list of the `object's which make up PAGE.  The list can
     be freely modified without changing the contents of PAGE.

 -- Function: page-append! page objects...
     Appends zero or more OBJECTS to the contents of PAGE in the order
     given.  Returns PAGE.

     If any of the OBJECTS is already part of a `page' other than PAGE,
     or is part of a component `object', raises an `object-state'
     error.  Any of the OBJECTS that are already in the PAGE are
     ignored.

 -- Function: page-remove! page objects...
     Removes zero or more OBJECTS from the contents of PAGE.  Returns
     PAGE.

     Any OBJECTS that are not part of a `page' or component `object'
     are ignored.

     An `object-state' error will be thrown if any of the OBJECTS
     satisfies any of the following conditions:

        * part of a `page' other than PAGE;

        * part of component `object';

        * has attached attributes (*note Attributes::);

        * is attached as an attribute.

 -- Function: object-page object
     Returns the `page' which contains OBJECT (either directly or
     indirectly), or `#f' if OBJECT is not part of a `page'.

     *Note*: If the OBJECT argument to `object-page' is part of a
     component `object' which is itself part of a `page', that `page'
     will be returned.

2.1.4 Page dirty flags
----------------------

A `page' has a _dirty flag_ that is used to indicate to applications
that the `page' has been modified since it was last loaded or saved.

 -- Function: page-dirty? page
     Returns `#t' if the PAGE's page has been marked as dirty;
     otherwise, returns `#f'.

 -- Function: set-page-dirty! page [state]
     Sets the dirty flag for PAGE.  If STATE is `#f', clears the dirty
     flag; otherwise, or if STATE is omitted, marks the page as dirty.
     Returns PAGE.

2.2 Core object functions
=========================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(geda object)' module.

* Boxes::
* Circles::

File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: General object functions,  Next: Lines,  Up: Core object functions

2.2.1 General object functions
------------------------------

 -- Function: object? obj
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJ is an `object'.

 -- Function: copy-object object
     Returns a deep copy of OBJECT.  The new `object' returned has no
     attached attributes, and is not part of a `page' or part of a
     component `object'.

 -- Function: object-component object
     Returns the component `object' that contains OBJECT, or `#f' if
     OBJECT is not part of a component.

 -- Function: object-connections object
     Returns a list of other `object's that are _directly_ connected to
     OBJECT.  If `object' is not included in a `page', raises an
     `object-state' error.  The connections reported are independent of
     inclusion in components.

     For example, consider a page containing a net and a component, and
     the component contains a single pin.  If the connectable end of
     the pin intersects the net, then `(object-connections <net>)' will
     return a list containing the pin `object', and _not_ the component.

2.2.1.1 Object sub-types
........................

Schematic element `object's come in several subtypes.

 -- Function: object-type object
     Returns the sub-type of OBJECT as a symbol.  The subtype will be
     one of the following symbols:

        * `arc'

        * `box'

        * `bus'

        * `circle'

        * `complex' (indicates a component `object')

        * `line'

        * `net'

        * `path'

        * `picture'

        * `pin'

        * `text'

 -- Function: object-type? object type
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is an `object' and that its
     subtype is TYPE, which should be a symbol.

2.2.1.2 Object transformations
..............................

Objects can be translated, rotated, or mirrored about a point.

 -- Function: translate-objects! vector [objects...]
     Translate OBJECTS by VECTOR, a world coordinate distance in the
     form `(x . y)'.  Returns a list of the modified OBJECTS.

 -- Function: rotate-objects! center angle [objects...]
     Translate OBJECTS anti-clockwise by ANGLE about CENTER, a world
     coordinate position in the form `(x . y)'.  ANGLE must be an
     integer multiple of 90 degrees.  Returns a list of the modified
     OBJECTS.

 -- Function: mirror-objects! x-offset [objects...]
     Mirror OBJECTS in the line `x = X-OFFSET'.  Returns a list of the
     modified OBJECTS.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Object bounds,  Next: Object color,  Prev: Object transformations,  Up: General object functions

2.2.1.3 Object bounds
.....................

The bounds of an object is the smallest bounding rectangle of the
object, expressed in document coordinates (*note Coordinate system::).

 -- Function: object-bounds objects...
     Returns the world coordinate bounding box containing all of the
     OBJECTS passed as arguments, or `#f' if none of the OBJECTS have
     bounds (for example, this can occur if no OBJECTS are specified,
     or if they are all empty component `object's).

     *Note*: `object-bounds' always returns the actual bounds of the
     OBJECTS, not the visible bounds.  This means that the bounds of
     invisible text is always included.

 -- Function: fold-bounds bounds...
     Calculates the union of several sets of BOUNDS (as returned by
     `object-bounds').  If any of the BOUNDS are `#f', they are
     skipped; if all of the BOUNDS are `#f', `#f' is returned.

2.2.1.4 Object color
....................

Object colors in gEDA documents are specified as indices into a color
map.  This allows users to specify the color map that suits them when
viewing schematics and symbols.

 -- Function: object-color object
     Returns the integer color map index of the color used to draw
     OBJECT.

 -- Function: set-object-color! object color
     Sets the integer color map index for OBJECT to COLOR.  Returns
     OBJECT.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Object fill and stroke,  Prev: Object color,  Up: General object functions

2.2.1.5 Object fill and stroke
..............................

Graphical object subtypes - lines, boxes, circles, arcs and paths - are
drawn with a stroke pattern that can be configured in detail.

 -- Function: object-stroke object
     Returns the stroke settings of the OBJECT, which must be a line,
     box, circle, arc or path `object'.  The return value is a list of
     parameters:

       1. stroke width, as an integer number of world units

       2. cap style, one of the symbols `none', `square' or `round'.

       3. dash style, one of the symbols `solid', `dotted', `dashed',
          `center' or `phantom'.

       4. up to two dash parameters, depending on the dash style:
             * for solid lines, no parameters;

             * for dotted lines, dot spacing;

             * for other styles, dot/dash spacing and dash length.

 -- Function: set-object-stroke! object width cap dash [dash-space
          [dash-length]]
     Set the stroke settings of the OBJECT, which must be a line, box,
     circle, arc or path `object'.  The arguments are the same as the
     contents of the list returned by `object-stroke'.  Returns OBJECT.

          `center' or `phantom'.

       2. for styles other than `solid', dot/dash spacing;

       3. for `dashed', `center' and `phantom', dash length.

   Some types of `object' - boxes, circles and paths - can have their
interiors filled with a variety of patterns.

 -- Function: object-fill object
     Returns the fill settings of OBJECT, which must be a box, circle
     or path `object'.  The return value is a list of one to six
     parameters:

       1. fill style, one of the symbols `hollow', `solid', `mesh' or

2.2.2 Lines
-----------

Line `object's are straight graphical line segments with no electrical
meaning.  A line's geometrical parameters are a start point and end
point, and it supports different colors and stroke styles.

   Many of the functions for manipulating lines are also used to
manipulate line-like objects such as nets, buses or pins.

 -- Function: line? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a line `object'.

 -- Function: make-line start end [color]
     Creates and returns a new line `object'.  START is the position of
     the start of the new line in the form `(x . y)' and END is the
     position of end of the line.  If COLOR is specified, it should be
     the integer color map index of the color with which to draw the
     line.  If COLOR is not specified, the default line color is used.

 -- Function: set-line! line start end [color]
     Sets the parameters of LINE (which may be a line, net, bus or pin
     `object').  The arguments are the same as to `make-line'.  Returns
     LINE.

 -- Function: line-info line
     Returns the parameters of LINE (which may be a line, net, bus or
     pin `object').  The return value is a list in the form:

          ((start-x . start-y) (end-x . end-y) color)

     *Note*: For pin `object's, first coordinate is the connectable
     point on the pin.

 -- Function: line-start line
     Returns the position `(x . y)' of the start of LINE (which may be
     a line, net, bus or pin `object').  For pin `objects', this is the
     position of the connectable point on the pin.

 -- Function: line-end line
     Returns the position `(x . y)' of the end of LINE (which may be a
     line, net, bus or pin `object').


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Nets and buses,  Next: Pins,  Prev: Lines,  Up: Core object functions

2.2.3 Nets and buses
--------------------

Net and bus `object's are straight line segments which represent
electrical connectivity.  Nets represent single wires, and buses
multi-wire connections of arbitrary composition.

   All of the functions that work on line `object's also work with nets
and buses (*note Lines::).  Note that `line?' will return `#f' if
called with a net or bus argument.

 -- Function: net? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a net.

 -- Function: make-net start end [color]
     Creates and returns a new net `object'.  START is the position of
     the start of the new net in the form `(x . y)' and END is the
     position of end of the net.  If COLOR is specified, it should be
     the integer color map index of the color with which to draw the
     net.  If COLOR is not specified, the default net color is used.

 -- Function: bus? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a bus.

 -- Function: make-bus start end [color]

2.2.4 Pins
----------

Pin `objects' are straight line segments which represent connectable
points in symbols or subcircuits, such as the pins of a semiconductor
package.  Only one end of a pin can be connected to nets, buses or
other pins; the rest of a pin is purely graphical.

   Pins come in two varieties: "net pins" and "bus pins", which are
used for connections to nets and buses respectively (*note Nets and
buses::).

   All of the functions that work on line `object's also work with pins
(*note Lines::).  Note that `line?' will return `#f' if called with a
pin argument.

 -- Function: pin? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a pin `object'.

 -- Function: net-pin? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a net pin.

 -- Function: make-net-pin start end [color]
     Creates and returns a new net pin `object'.  START is the position
     of the start of the new pin (the connectable end) in the form `(x
     . y)' and END is the position of end of the pin.  If COLOR is
     specified, it should be the integer color map index of the color
     with which to draw the pin.  If COLOR is not specified, the
     default pin color is used.

 -- Function: bus-pin? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a bus pin.

 -- Function: make-bus-pin start end [color]
     Creates and returns a new bus pin `object'.  Arguments are as for
     `make-net-pin'.

2.2.5 Boxes
-----------

Boxes are rectangles specified by the coordinates of their top left and
bottom right corners.  They are purely graphical, and have no
electrical meaning.  They can be drawn in different colors, and with
various stroke and fill settings.

   *Note Object color::.  *Note Object fill and stroke::.

 -- Function: box? object
     Returns `#t' if and only of OBJECT is a box `object'.

 -- Function: make-box top-left bottom-right [color]
     Creates and returns a new box `object'.  TOP-LEFT is the position
     of the top left of the new box in the form `(x . y)', and
     BOTTOM-RIGHT is the position of the bottom right of the box.  If
     COLOR is specified, it should be the integer color map index of
     the color with which to draw the box.  If COLOR is not specified,
     the default box color is used.

 -- Function: set-box! box top-left bottom-right [color]
     Sets the parameters of BOX. The arguments are the same as to
     `make-box'.  Returns BOX.

 -- Function: box-info box
     Returns the parameters of BOX.  The return value is a list in the
     form:

          ((top-left-x . top-left-y) (bottom-right-x . bottom-right-y) color)

 -- Function: box-top-left box
     Returns the position of the top left corner of BOX in the form `(x
     . y)'.

 -- Function: box-bottom-right box
     Returns the position of the bottom right corner of BOX in the form
     `(x . y)'.

2.2.6 Circles
-------------

Circle `objects' are specified by center position and radius, and are
purely graphical with no electrical meaning.  They can be drawn in
different colors, and with various stroke and fill settings.

   *Note Object color::.  *Note Object fill and stroke::.

 -- Function: circle? object
     Returns `#t' if and only of OBJECT is a circle `object'.

 -- Function: make-circle center radius [color]
     Creates and returns a new circle `object'.  CENTER is the position
     of the center of the new circle in the form `(x . y)', and RADIUS
     is the integer radius of the circle.  If COLOR is specified, it
     should be the integer color map index of the color with which to
     draw the circle.  If COLOR is not specified, the default circle
     color is used.

 -- Function: set-circle! circle center radius [color]
     Sets the parameters of CIRCLE. The arguments are the same as to
     `make-circle'.  Returns CIRCLE.

 -- Function: circle-info circle
     Returns the parameters of CIRCLE as a list of the form:

          ((center-x . center-y) radius color)

 -- Function: circle-center circle

2.2.7 Arcs
----------

Arc `objects' are specified by center position, radius, and start and
end angles.  They are purely graphical with no electrical meaning. They
can be drawn in different colors, and with various stroke settings.

 -- Function: arc? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is an arc `object'.

 -- Function: make-arc center radius start-angle end-angle [color]
     Creates and returns a new arc `object'.  CENTER is the position of
     the center of the new arc in the form `(x . y)', and RADIUS is the
     integer radius of the arc.  START-ANGLE and END-ANGLE are the
     angles at which to start and end the arc, in degrees. If COLOR is
     specified, it should be the integer color map index of the color
     with which to draw the arc.  If COLOR is not specified, the
     default arc color is used.

 -- Function: set-arc! arc center radius start-angle end-angle [color]
     Sets the parameters of ARC. The arguments are the same as to
     `make-arc'. Returns ARC.

 -- Function: arc-info arc

2.2.8 Paths
-----------

Paths are arbitrary shapes comprised of straight lines and Bézier
curves.  Each path contains a sequence of _path elements_, each of
which requires zero or more absolute position parameters.  The element
types supported by gEDA are:

   * `moveto' elements represent a step (without drawing) to another
     point in the schematic, and begin a new subpath.  `moveto'
     elements need a single position parameter, which is the position of
     the endpoint of the move.

   * `lineto' elements draw a straight line from the current point to
     the point specified by a single position parameter.

   * `curveto' elements draw a Bézier curve from the current point.
     The curve requires three position parameters: the position of the
     first control point; the position of the second control point; and
     the endpoint of the curve.

   * `closepath' elements close the current subpath by drawing a
     straight line from the current point to the subpath's initial
     point.  They take no parameters.

 -- Function: path? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a path `object'.

 -- Function: path-length path
     Returns the number of path elements in PATH.

 -- Function: path-ref path K
     Returns the Kth element in PATH.  The return value is a list.  The
     first item in the list is a symbol indicating the type of element,
     and any additional items are the position parameters of the
     element.  For example, a call to `path-ref' might return:

          (curveto (800 . 525) (700 . 700) (500 . 700))

     If K is not a valid offset into PATH, raises an `out-of-range'
     error.

 -- Function: path-remove! path K
     Removes the Kth element in PATH, returning PATH.  If K is not a
     valid offset, raises an `out-of-range' error.

 -- Function: path-insert! path K type [positions...]
     Inserts a new element into PATH at index K.  TYPE is a symbol
     indicating the type of element to insert, using the parameters
     POSITIONS.  If K is less than zero or greater than the number of
     elements PATH already contains, the new element is appended to the
     path.  For example, to append a straight line section to the
     current path:

          (path-insert! path -1 'lineto '(500. 100))

2.2.9 Pictures
--------------

A picture object displays an image in the schematic, and is a purely
graphical element.  Pictures may be in any format supported by the
user's GdkPixbuf installation (but note that images that can't be
loaded for some reason are preserved).  The TOP-LEFT, BOTTOM-RIGHT,
ANGLE and MIRROR properties of a picture object indicate the
transformation that was applied to the original image.  The
transformation is applied as follows:

  1. If MIRROR is true, the picture is reflected about its vertical
     centerline.

  2. The picture is rotated by ANGLE anticlockwise about its center
     (ANGLE may only be an integer multiple of 90 degrees).

  3. The picture is scaled and translated to fit within the rectangle
     defined by the points TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT.

 -- Function: picture? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a picture `object'.

 -- Function: make-picture/vector vector filename top-left bottom-right
          angle mirror
     Creates and returns a new picture object for FILENAME, by reading
     image data from VECTOR (which should be in a standard image file
     format).  If VECTOR could not be loaded, an error is raised.
     TOP-LEFT, BOTTOM-RIGHT, ANGLE and MIRROR specify the picture
     transformation.

     The points TOP-LEFT and BOTTOM-RIGHT should be specified in the
     form `(x . y)'.

 -- Function: set-picture! picture top-left bottom-right angle mirror
     Sets the picture transformation for PICTURE.

 -- Function: picture-info picture
     Returns the parameters of PICTURE as a list in the form:

          ((top-left-x . top-left-y) (bottom-right-x . bottom-right-y) angle mirror)

 -- Function: picture-filename picture
     Returns the filename associated with PICTURE as a string.

 -- Function: picture-top-left picture
     Returns the position of the top left corner of `picture' in the
     form `(x . y)'.

 -- Function: picture-bottom-right picture
     Returns the position of the bottom right corner of `picture' in
     the form `(x . y)'.

 -- Function: picture-angle picture
     Returns the angle to rotate `picture' by, as an integer number of
     degrees.

 -- Function: picture-mirror? picture
     Returns true if `picture' is mirrored.

2.2.10 Text
-----------

Text fulfils two roles, as straightforward labels and notes on
schematics and symbols, and as attached or floating attributes (*note
Attributes::).  A text `object' can be aligned in different ways
relative to its anchor position, and can be displayed in different font
sizes.

   Any text can be set to be visible or invisible on printed output (and
gschem provides ways to preview invisible text).  When a text `object'
is an attribute (i.e. its string is in a `NAME=VALUE' format) then the
visibility settings are more fine-grained: the text can be set to
display just the attribute name, just the attribute value, or both.

   *Note Attributes::.

 -- Function: text? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a text `object'.

 -- Function: make-text anchor align angle string size visible show
          [color]
     Creates and returns a new text `object'.  ANCHOR is the position
     of the anchor of the new text in the form `(x . y)', and ALIGN is
     a symbol determining how the text should be aligned relative to
     the anchor.  ALIGN must be one of the following symbols:

        * `lower-left'

        * `middle-left'

        * `upper-left'

        * `lower-center'

        * `middle-center'

        * `upper-center'

        * `lower-right'

        * `middle-right'

        * `upper-right'

     For example, if ALIGN is `upper-center', the anchor will be
     located at the top center of the rendered text block.

     ANGLE should be an integer multiple of 90 degrees, determining the
     angle which the text should be displayed at.  STRING is the string
     contents for the `text' object, and must not contain any null
     characters (`#\0' in Scheme, Unicode `U+0000'. SIZE is the font
     size to use.  If VISIBLE is `#f', the text will be invisible;
     otherwise, it will be visible.

     When the STRING is in an attribute format (*note Attributes::),
     the SHOW argument determines which parts of the STRING will be
     displayed.  It must be one of the following symbols:

        * `name'

        * `value'

        * `both'

     If COLOR is specified, it should be the integer color map index of
     the color with which to draw the text.  If COLOR is not specified,
     the default arc color is used.

 -- Function: set-text! text anchor align angle string size visible
          show [color]
     Sets the parameters of TEXT. The arguments are the same as to
     `make-text'. Returns TEXT.

 -- Function: text-info text
     Returns the parameters of TEXT as a list in the form:

          ((anchor-x . anchor-y) align angle string size visible show color)

     See `make-text' for a description of all of these parameters.

 -- Function: text-center text
     Returns the position of the anchor of TEXT in the form `(x . y)'.

 -- Function: text-align text
     Returns the alignment of TEXT as one of the following symbols:

        * `lower-left'

        * `middle-left'

        * `upper-left'

        * `lower-center'

        * `middle-center'

        * `upper-center'

        * `lower-right'

        * `middle-right'

        * `upper-right'

 -- Function: text-angle text
     Returns the angle that TEXT is displayed at as an integer multiple
     of 90 degrees.

 -- Function: text-string text
     Returns the string content of TEXT.

 -- Function: set-text-string! text str
     Set the string content of TEXT to STR.  STR must not contain any
     null characters (`#\0' in Scheme, Unicode `U+0000').

 -- Function: text-size text
     Return the font size of TEXT as an integer.

 -- Function: text-visible? text
     Returns `#t' if and only if TEXT is set to be visible.

 -- Function: set-text-visibility! text visible?
     If VISIBLE? is `#f', sets TEXT to be invisible; otherwise, sets it
     to be visible.

 -- Function: text-attribute-mode text
     Returns a symbol indicating which parts of TEXT will be displayed
     when TEXT is a valid attribute.  The returned value will be one of
     the following symbols:

        * `name'

        * `value'

        * `both'

2.2.11 Components
-----------------

Component `object's represent instances of symbols.  They contain other
`object's copied from the original symbol when it is instantiated into
a schematic.

   A component's BASENAME is a string used to identify which symbol it
originated from.  When instantiating a symbol on initial placement in a
schematic, or when recreating a component while loading a schematic,
the BASENAME is used to find the underlying symbol file in the
component library.

   *Note Component objects::.

   *Note*: In the gEDA C source code, these are normally called
"complex" objects.  However, as Guile Scheme supports complex numbers,
and the procedures related to working with complex numbers use the word
`complex' to describe them, this API uses `component' to avoid
ambiguity.

   The POSITION, ANGLE and MIRROR flag of a component indicates the
transformation that was applied to the contents of the original symbol.
The transformation is applied in the following order:

  1. If MIRROR is true, the symbol is reflected in the line x = 0.

  2. The symbol is rotated anti-clockwise by ANGLE degrees about the
     point (0,0) (ANGLE may only be an integer multiple of 90 degrees).

  3. Finally, the symbol is translated by POSITION.

   The component's contents (as returned by `component-contents') have
the transformation already applied to them.  Updating the translation
information using e.g. `set-component!' will not alter them - that must
be done separately (e.g. by reloading the symbol).

 -- Function: component? object
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJECT is a component `object'.

 -- Function: make-component basename position angle mirror locked
     Creates and returns a new, empty component `object' with the given
     BASENAME.  POSITION, ANGLE and MIRROR specify the symbol
     transformation.  If LOCKED is true, the component will be
     protected against accidental selection by the user (this is used
     in gschem e.g. for titleblocks).

     No attempt is made to load a symbol matching BASENAME from
     component libraries, and the returned component is flagged as
     embedded.

 -- Function: make-component/library basename position angle mirror
          locked
     Searches the component libraries for a symbol matching BASENAME,
     and if found, instantiates the symbol and returns the resulting
     component (which is not flagged as embedded).  Arguments are as for
     `make-component'.

     If no match for BASENAME is found, `#f' is returned.

 -- Function: set-component! component position angle mirror locked
     Sets the parameters of COMPONENT.  Arguments are the same as to
     `make-component'.  Returns COMPONENT.

     *Note*: Remember that modifying the transformation parameters of a
     component does not update the component's contents.

 -- Function: component-info component
     Returns the parameters of COMPONENT as a list of the form:

          (basename (x . y) angle mirror locked)

 -- Function: component-basename component
     Returns the basename of COMPONENT.

 -- Function: component-position component
     Returns the position to which the original symbol was translated
     when creating COMPONENT.

 -- Function: component-angle component
     Returns the angle by which the original symbol was rotated when
     creating COMPONENT, as an integer number of degrees.

 -- Function: component-mirror? component
     Returns true if the original symbol was mirrored when creating
     COMPONENT.

 -- Function: component-locked? component
     Returns true if COMPONENT is non-selectable.

 -- Function: component-contents component
     Returns the contents of COMPONENTS as a list of objects.

 -- Function: component-append! component objects...
     Appends OBJECTS (which must not be component `object's) to the
     contents of COMPONENT.  Any OBJECTS which are already included in
     COMPONENT are ignored.  If any OBJECTS are already part of a
     `page' or of another component `object', an `object-state' error
     is raised. Returns COMPONENT.

 -- Function: component-remove! component objects...
     Removes OBJECTS from the contents of COMPONENT.  Any OBJECTS which
     are not part of a component or of a page are ignored. Returns
     COMPONENT.

     An `object-state' error will be raised if any OBJECTS satisfy any
     of the following conditions:

        * are part of a `page';

        * are part of a component `object' other than COMPONENT;

        * have attached attributes

        * are attached as an attribute.

2.3 Core attribute functions
============================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(geda attrib)' module.

   Attributes are text `object's with a particular format of string.
They can be floating, or they can be attached to another `object'.

 -- Function: attribute? object
     Returns true if and only if OBJECT is an attribute (i.e. a text
     `object' and in attribute format).

2.3.1 Attribute names and values
--------------------------------

 -- Function: parse-attrib text
     Splits the string from TEXT (a text `object') into name and value,
     if it is in attribute format.  If it is not in attribute format,
     raises an `attribute-format' error.  The return value is in the
     form `(NAME . VALUE)'.

 -- Function: attrib-name attrib
     Returns the name part of ATTRIB, as a string.

 -- Function: attrib-value attrib
     Returns the value part of ATTRIB, as a string.

 -- Function: set-attrib-value! attrib value
     Sets the value part of ATTRIB to VALUE.

2.3.2 Attribute attachment
--------------------------

 -- Function: attrib-attachment attrib
     If ATTRIB is attached to another `object', returns that object.
     Otherwise, returns `#f'.

 -- Function: object-attribs object
     Returns a list of all attributes attached to OBJECT.

 -- Function: attach-attribs! object [attribs...]
     Attach ATTRIBS to OBJECT.  All the ATTRIBS must be text `object's.
     The following conditions must be satisfied, or an `object-state'
     error will be raised:

        * Neither OBJECT nor any of the ATTRIBS may be already attached
          as an attribute;

        * Both OBJECT and all ATTRIBS must be part of the same `page'
          and/or component `object';

     Any ATTRIBS that are already attached to OBJECT are ignored.
     Returns OBJECT.

     *Note*: For historical reasons, `attach-attribs!' does not require
     that all ATTRIBS satisfy `attribute?'.  Nevertheless, avoid
     attaching non-attribute text objects as attributes.

 -- Function: detach-attribs! object [attribs...]
     Detach ATTRIBS from OBJECT.  Any ATTRIBS that are not attached as
     attributes are ignored.  If any ATTRIBS are attached to `object's
     other than OBJECT, an `object-state' error is raised.

2.3.3 Inherited and promoted attributes
---------------------------------------

"Inherited attributes" are unattached attributes inside a component
`object'.

 -- Function: inherited-attribs object
     Returns the inherited attributes of OBJECT, if OBJECT is a
     component.  If OBJECT is not a component, returns the empty list.

 -- Function: attrib-inherited? attrib
     Returns `#t' if ATTRIB is an inherited attribute.

   "promotable attributes" are inherited attributes that are both
visible and have names that are in the list of promotable attributes
set with the `always-promote-attributes' rc file parameter.

 -- Function: promotable-attribs component
     Returns a list of promotable attributes of COMPONENT.

 -- Function: promote-attribs! component
     Promote all promotable attributes from COMPONENT into the `page'
     that contains COMPONENT.  If COMPONENT is not in a page, an
     `object-state' error is raised.

     All promotable attributes are copied, and made invisible.  The
     copies are added to the `page', and attached as attributes of
     COMPONENT.

     The promoted attributes are returned.  If COMPONENT is not in fact
     a component `object', does nothing and returns the empty list.

2.4 Configuration functions
===========================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(geda config)' module.

   This section describes some functions for accessing, monitoring and
modifying the configuration of gEDA libraries and applications.

* Menu:

* Configuration contexts::
* Configuration parameters::
* Configuration events::
* Configuration errors::


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Configuration contexts,  Next: Configuration parameters,  Up: Configuration functions

2.4.1 Configuration contexts
----------------------------

A configuration parameter is always evaluated within a "configuration
context".  Each context is associated with a configuration file
(although the file does not necessarily need to exist).

   Each configuration context may have a "parent context".  If, when
looking up a parameter, it has no value set in the selected context,
the parent context is checked, and so on.

   Three special contexts are always automatically defined: the
"default context", the "system context" and the "user context".  The
user context is the default parent context for all other configuration
contexts, including newly-created ones.

2.4.1.1 Obtaining a context
...........................

 -- Function: path-config-context path
     Normally, you shouldn't create a configuration context directly;
     you should obtain the configuration context associated with a PATH.

     `path-config-context' looks for a configuration file named
     `geda.conf'.  If PATH is not a directory, it is truncated, and
     then a file named `geda.conf' is looked for in that directory.  If
     none is found, the parent directory is checked, and so on until a
     configuration file is found or the filesystem root is reached.  If
     no configuration file was found, the returned context will be
     associated with a `geda.conf' in the same directory as PATH.

     *Warning*: Do not assume that the configuration file associated
     with the context returned by `path-config-context' is located in
     the directory specified by PATH.

 -- Function: default_config_context
     The default context is not associated with any physical path or
     on-disk configuration file, and has no parent context.  It contains
     the default configuration used when no configuration file can be
     loaded.

     *Note*: Normally, the default context should be populated with
     built-in default configuration settings on start-up, before loading
     any further configuration files.  This approach is strongly
     recommended, because it means that configuration parameters can
     then be safely read without having to use `config-has-group?' and
     `config-has-key?' to check if they are set (*note Configuration
     groups and keys: Configuration parameters.).

 -- Function: system-config-context
     The system context is used for system-wide configuration.  Its
     parent context is the default context.  It is located:

       1. By searching `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS' for a `gEDA/geda-system.conf'
          file.

       2. By checking the system configuration directory specified at
          compile-time for a `gEDA/geda-system.conf' file.

 -- Function: user-config-context
     The user context is used for user-specific configuration, and is
     loaded from `gEDA/geda-user.conf' in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME'.  Its
     parent context is the system context.

2.4.1.2 Loading and saving configuration files
..............................................

Other than the default context, all configuration contexts are
associated with an on-disk configuration file.

 -- Function: config-filename cfg
     Return the filename of the configuration file associated with the
     context CFG.  For some contexts (including the default context),
     this will return `#f'.

 -- Function: config-load! cfg
     Attempt to load configuration parameters for the context CFG from
     its associated file.

 -- Function: config-loaded? cfg
     Determine whether the context CFG has been successfully loaded
     from file.

 -- Function: config-save! cfg
     Attempt to save configuration parameters for the context CFG to
     its associated file.

 -- Function: config-changed? cfg
     Determine whether the context CFG has been altered since it was
     last synchronised with the on-disk version by loading or saving it.

2.4.1.3 Context parents
.......................

A configuration context may have a "parent context", from which it
inherits configuration values.  Configuration inheritance loops are not
permitted.

   *Note Configuration inheritance: Configuration parameters.

 -- Function: context-parent cfg
     Return the parent context of the context CFG, if it has one.

 -- Function: set-config-parent! cfg parent
     Sets PARENT as the parent context of CFG.  If PARENT is `#f', sets
     CFG as having no parent context.

     *Note*: Normally, application code should avoid using this
     function; keeping to the default configuration inheritance
     structure is recommended in order to ensure consistent behaviour
     of all libgeda applications.

2.4.1.4 Context trust
.....................

Some configuration parameters are dangerous; in particular, parameters
that may lead to arbitrary code execution need to be handled carefully.
Such settings might include:

   * Preferred PDF reader

   * Preferred web browser

   * Search path for Scheme plugins

   Configuration contexts can be flagged as being "trusted".  This
allows code that needs to access such dangerous parameters to determine
whether the value has been obtained from a safe source.

   By default, the default context, system context and user context are
trusted, and all other contexts untrusted.

 -- Function: config-trusted? cfg
     Test whether CFG is a trusted configuration context.

 -- Function: set-config-trusted! cfg trusted?
     Set whether the configuration context CFG should be trusted as a
     source for dangerous configuration parameters.

     *Warning*: You should not set a configuration context as trusted
     unless you are certain that it originated from a safe source (e.g.
     by interacting with the user to verify it).

 -- Function: config-trusted-context cfg
     If CFG is trusted, returns CFG; otherwise, returns the first
     parent context of CFG that is a trusted context.  If no trusted
     context can be found, returns `#f'.

2.4.2 Configuration parameters
------------------------------

A gEDA "configuration parameter" consists of three components:

"Group"
     A string which identifies the general category in which the
     parameter lies (e.g. which application and/or plugin).

"Name"
     A string which specifically identifies the parameter within the
     group.

"Value"
     The value of the parameter. This is stored as a string, but can be
     converted to a number of possible scalar and list types.

   Groups, names and values are all case-sensitive.

2.4.2.1 Configuration groups and keys
.....................................

 -- Function: config-groups cfg
     Returns a list of all groups available in CFG and its parent
     contexts.

 -- Function: config-has-group? cfg group
     Determines whether CFG or its parent contexts contain the
     specified GROUP

 -- Function: config-keys cfg group
     Returns a list of all keys available in the specified GROUP in CFG
     and its parent contexts.

 -- Function: config-has-key? cfg group key
     Determines whether CFG or its parent contexts contains KEY in the
     specified GROUP.

2.4.2.2 Configuration inheritance
.................................

If a configuration context does not directly specify a value for a
configuration parameter, it inherits the value from its parent context.

   *Note Context parents: Configuration contexts.

 -- Function: config-inherited? cfg group key
     Returns `#f' if value of the configuration parameter with the
     given GROUP and KEY is specified in the context CFG, and `#t' if
     it is inherited from a parent context of CFG.

 -- Function: config-source cfg group key
     Returns the configuration context (either CFG or one of its parent
     contexts) in which the configuration parameter with the given
     GROUP and KEY has its value defined.

2.4.2.3 Configuration values
............................

Each value is stored as a UTF-8 string in the configuration file.
However, this string can be parsed a several different types.  All of
the following types are supported:

   * Strings

   * Booleans

   * Exact integers

   * Inexact real numbers

   In addition, lists of all the above are supported.

 -- Function: config-string cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a string.

 -- Function: config-boolean cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a boolean.

 -- Function: config-int cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as an exact integer.

 -- Function: config-real cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as an inexact real number.

 -- Function: config-string-list cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a list of strings.

 -- Function: config-boolean-list cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a list of booleans.

 -- Function: config-int-list cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a list of exact integers.

 -- Function: config-real-list cfg group key
     Retrieve configuration value as a list of inexact real numbers.

 -- Function: config-set! cfg group key value
     Set the configuration parameter identified by the given GROUP and
     KEY in the configuration context CFG.  The type of value to set is
     inferred from VALUE.

2.4.3 Configuration events
--------------------------

When the value of a configuration parameter is altered, either directly
or by loading a configuration file, a "configuration event" is
generated.  Handlers can be registered to be notified when a
configuration event occurs.  A configuration event is associated with
the group and key that had its value modified.

   If a configuration event is emitted by a configuration context, it
propagates to all configuration contexts which inherit that group and
key from it.

   A configuration event handler must be a closure that accepts three
arguments:

     handler cfg group key

   CFG is always the configuration context that received the event, and
the GROUP and KEY identify the configuration parameter that changed.

 -- Function: add-config-event! cfg handler
     Registers HANDLER to be called when configuration changes in the
     context CFG.

 -- Function: remove-config-event! cfg handler
     Stops HANDLER from being called when configuration changes in the
     context CFG.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Configuration errors,  Prev: Configuration events,  Up: Configuration functions

2.4.4 Configuration errors
--------------------------

All errors in functions in the `(geda config)' are reported using one
of two keys:

  1. File errors (e.g. "Access denied" or "File not found" are
     indicated with the `system-error' key.

  2. All other errors are indicated using the `config-error' key.

   When a `config-error' is signalled, `data' part of the error
arguments is a list containing one of the following symbols:

`unknown-encoding'
     The text being parsed was in an unknown encoding.

`parse'
     The configuration data wass ill-formed.

`key-not-found'
     A requested configuration key was not found.

`group-not-found'
     A requested configuration group was not found.

`invalid-value'
     A configuration value could not be parsed into the requested
     format.

2.5 System information
======================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(geda os)' module.

   This section describes some functions and variables that are useful
for Scheme code that needs to behave differently depending on which
operating system gEDA is running on.

 -- Variable: separator-char
     The directory separator character that should be used on the host
     platform.

 -- Variable: separator
     A string containing `separator-char'.

 -- Variable: path-separator-char
     The character used for separating the elements in `PATH'-like
     environment variables on the host platform.

 -- Variable: path-separator
     A string containing `path-separator-char'.

 -- Function: platform
     Returns a list of symbols describing the host platform.  The
     returned symbols may include:

        * `carbon'

        * `cygwin'

        * `linux'

        * `win32'

        * `win32-native'

 -- Function: platform? type
     Returns `#t' if the platform description list returned by
     `platform' contains the symbol TYPE, and `#f' otherwise.

 -- Function: sys-data-dirs
     Returns an ordered list of directories in which to access
     system-wide gEDA data.

 -- Function: sys-config-dirs
     Returns an ordered list of directories in which to access
     system-wide gEDA configuration information.

 -- Function: user-data-dir
     Returns the directory in which to store user-specific gEDA data.

 -- Function: user-config-dir
     Returns the directory in which to store user-specific gEDA
     configuration information.

 -- Function: expand-env-variables str
     Recursively expands STR until no more environment variables can be
     expanded, and return the expanded string. Environment variables
     are in the form `${VAR}'.

          (expand-env-variables "${HOME}/path/to/dir")

File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Windows and views,  Next: Key mapping,  Up: gschem API Reference

3.1 Windows and views
=====================

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(gschem window)' module.

 -- Function: active-page
     Returns the `page' currently being displayed for editing.

 -- Function: set-active-page! page
     Sets the current `page' to PAGE.

 -- Function: pointer-position
     Returns the current mouse pointer position in world coordinates in
     the form `(x . y)'.  If the pointer is outside the display area,
     returns `#f'.

 -- Function: snap-point point
     Snaps the given POINT to the current snap grid, i.e. returns the
     closest grid location to POINT.  Expects a point in the form `(x .
     y)', and returns a point in the same format.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Key mapping,  Next: Selections,  Prev: Windows and views,  Up: gschem API Reference

3.2 Key mapping
===============

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(gschem keymap)' module.

3.2.1 Key combinations
----------------------

gschem treats key combinations as first-class objects.  A key
combination consists of a non-modifier key press with some number of
modifiers applied.  For example, the key combination `Ctrl+Shift+A'
(which calls *Edit→Deselect* by default) is typed by holding the
<Ctrl> and <Shift> keys down, and then pressing <A>.

 -- Function: key? obj
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJ is a key combination.

 -- Function: string->key str
     Parses STR to create a new key combination.  The expected format
     looks like `<Control>a' or `<Shift><Alt>F1'.  Key names are parsed
     using `gdk_keyval_from_name()', and modifiers may appear in any
     order.  If STR has invalid syntax or does not represent a valid
     key combination, raises a `key-format' error.

 -- Function: key->string key
     Converts KEY to a string, using a format suitable for passing to
     `string->key'.

 -- Function: key->display-string key
     Converts KEY to a string, using a format suitable for display.
     This should be used when the key combination needs to be displayed
     to the user e.g. in the gschem menus or status area.  The returned
     string is translated according to the user's current locale.

          (key->display-string (string->key ``<Control>bracketright''))
          => ``Ctrl+]''

3.2.2 Key sequences
-------------------

Most gschem functionality is bound not to single key combinations but to
sequences of them.  For example, *File→New* is bound to `F N' by
default (i.e. press <F> followed by <N>).  Key sequences are simply
vectors of key bindings.  For example:

     (string->keys ``F N'')
     => #(#<gschem-key "F"> #<gschem-key "N">)

   In this case, <F> is a "prefix key", because pressing it does not
cause an action to be carried out directly, but just changes the effect
of pressing subsequent keys.

 -- Function: keys? obj
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJ is a valid key sequence.

 -- Function: string->keys str
     Parses STR into a key sequence.  The expected format is a sequence
     of key combination specifications (as could be passed to
     `string->key') separated by spaces.

 -- Function: keys->string keys
     Converts the key sequence KEYS to a string, using a format
     suitable for passing to `string->keys'.

 -- Function: keys->display-string keys
     Converts the key sequence KEYS to a string, using a format
     suitable for display.

3.2.3 Keymaps
-------------

A "keymap" maps key combinations to actions or other keymaps.

 -- Function: keymap? obj
     Returns `#t' if and only if OBJ is a keymap.

 -- Function: make-keymap
     Creates and returns a new, empty keymap.

 -- Function: keymap-bind-key! keymap key [bindable]
     Binds KEY to BINDABLE in KEYMAP.  If BINDABLE is `#f' or not
     specified, removes the binding for KEY.  BINDABLE should be a
     thunk or a keymap.

 -- Function: keymap-lookup-key keymap key
     Looks up the binding for KEY in KEYMAP.  If KEY is not bound,
     returns `#f'.

 -- Function: keymap-lookup-binding keymap bindable
     Carries out a reverse lookup in KEYMAP to find the key bound to
     BINDABLE.  If BINDABLE is not bound in KEYMAP, returns `#f'.

 -- Function: keymap-for-each proc keymap
     Applies PROC to each binding in KEYMAP.  PROC should take two
     arguments: the bound key, and its binding.

   Actions are bound to key sequences by binding the first key
combination to a keymap, then in the resulting keymap binding the
second key combination, etc.  This results in a directed graph of
keymaps.

   For example, to bind the key sequence `F N', a keymap is created
containing a binding for <N> to the desired action, and then in the
main keymap the prefix key <F> is bound to the new keymap.

   Three helper functions are provided for working with key sequence
bindings.

 -- Function: bind-keys! keymap keys [bindable]
     Bind KEYS to BINDABLE.  Keys may be a key sequence vector, a
     single key combination, or a string representing a key sequence or
     key combination.  If BINDABLE is `#f' or not specified, removes
     the binding for KEYS.  BINDABLE should be a thunk or a keymap.

     If KEYS contains invalid prefix keys (e.g. because one of the
     prefix keys is already bound to something other than a keymap),
     raises an error.  Missing prefix keymaps are created as required.

 -- Function: lookup-keys keymap keys
     Looks up the binding for KEYS in KEYMAP.  KEYS is interpreted the
     same as for `bind-keys!'.  If KEYS is not bound, returns `#f'.

 -- Function: lookup-binding keymap bindable
     Recursively searches KEYMAP for the key sequence bound to
     BINDABLE, which should be a thunk or a keymap.  If BINDABLE is not
     bound, returns `#f'.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Selections,  Next: Hooks,  Prev: Key mapping,  Up: gschem API Reference

3.3 Selections
==============

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(gschem selection)' module.

   Each `page' in gschem has a "selection" associated with it, which is
some subset of the `page's contents.  Most actions in gschem operate on
the currently selected objects.

 -- Function: page-selection page
     Returns the current selection for PAGE, as a list of `object's.

 -- Function: object-selected? object
     Returns `#t' if OBJECT is in its containing page's selection.
     Otherwise, returns `#f'.  If OBJECT is not in a `page', raises an
     `object-state' error.

     *Note*: OBJECT must be _directly_ included in a `page', not via
     inclusion in a component `object'.

 -- Function: select-object! object
     Adds OBJECT to the selection of its containing `page'.  If OBJECT
     is not directly included in a `page', raises an `object-state'
     error.  If OBJECT is already selected, does nothing.  Returns
     OBJECT.

     *Note*: This function does not call `select-objects-hook'.

 -- Function: deselect-object! object
     Removes OBJECT from the selection of its containing `page'.  If
     OBJECT is not directly included in a `page', raises an
     `object-state' error.  If OBJECT is not selected, does nothing.
     Returns OBJECT.

     *Note*: This function does not call `deselect-objects-hook'.


File: geda-scheme.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Miscellanous gschem functions,  Prev: Selections,  Up: gschem API Reference

3.4 Hooks
=========

To use the hooks described in this section, you will need to load the
`(gschem hook)' module.

   gschem defines a number of hooks that allow functions to be
automatically run whenever a number of built-in actions are invoked by
the user.

   Most Scheme functions do not call these hooks.  If it makes sense for
your code to invoke a standard hook, you should normally do so
explicitly.

   *Warning*: Functions added to these standard hooks should not
normally modify their arguments.

   For more information on hooks in Guile, *note Hooks: (guile)Hooks.

 -- Variable: add-object-hook
     Called after objects are added to the page, at their initial
     creation.  The argument is a list of the objects being added.

 -- Variable: remove-objects-hook
     Called after objects are removed from the page.  Argument is a
     list of the objects being removed.

 -- Variable: move-objects-hook
     Called after objects are moved.  Argument is a list of the objects
     that were mirrored.

 -- Variable: mirror-objects-hook
     Called after objects are mirrored.  Argument is a list of the
     objects that were mirrored.

 -- Variable: rotate-objects-hook
     Called after objects are rotated.  Argument is a list of the
     objects that were rotated.

 -- Variable: paste-objects-hook
     Called after objects are pasted to the page, either via *Edit →
     Copy Mode* or similar, or via buffers, or via the clipboard.
     Argument is a list of the objects that were pasted.

 -- Variable: attach-attribs-hook
     Called after attributes are attached to something.  The argument
     is a list of the attributes that were attached.

 -- Variable: detach-attribs-hook
     Called after attributes are detached from something.  The argument
     is a list of the attributes that were detached.

 -- Variable: select-objects-hook
     Called after objects are added to the selection.  The argument is a
     list of objects that were selected.

 -- Variable: deselect-objects-hook
     Called after objects are removed from the selection.  The argument
     is a list of objects that were deselected.

 -- Variable: new-page-hook
     Called when a new page is created. The argument is the new page.

3.5 Miscellaneous gschem functions
==================================

3.5.1 gschem Attribute Helpers
------------------------------

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(gschem attrib)' module.

 -- Function: add-attrib! target name value visible show
     Create a new attribute, either attached to a TARGET `object' in
     the current `page', or floating in the current `page' if TARGET is
     `#f'.  The NAME and VALUE for the attribute must be strings, and
     if visible is `#f', the attribute will be invisible.  The SHOW
     argument controls which parts of the attribute will be visible,
     and must be one of the following symbols:

        * `name'

        * `value'

        * `both'

     This function exists to provide a way for actions defined in
     Scheme to use the same attribute placement heuristics as gschem's
     built-in *Add Attribute* action.

     *Note Text::, *note Attributes:: and *note Windows and views::.

3.5.2 Miscellaneous utility functions
-------------------------------------

To use the functions described in this section, you will need to load
the `(gschem util)' module.

 -- Function: show-uri uri
     Open URI in the registered default application associated for that
     type of file or protocol.  URI should be fully-qualified URI;
     which URIs can be handled by `show-uri' will depend on the system
     configuration.

 -- Function: show-file filename
     Displays a file in the registered default application for files of
     that type. FILENAME should be the absolute path and filename of a
     local file.
