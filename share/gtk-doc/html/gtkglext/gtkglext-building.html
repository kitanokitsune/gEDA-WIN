<a name="overview"></a><h2>Building GtkGLExt on UNIX-like systems</h2>
<p>
      This chapter covers building and installing GtkGLExt on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux. Compiling GtkGLExt on Microsoft
      Windows is different in detail and somewhat more difficult to
      get going since the necessary tools aren't included with
      the operating system.
    </p>
<p>
      On UNIX-like systems GtkGLExt uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <span class="application">autoconf</span> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <span class="application">automake</span> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <span class="application">libtool</span> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </p>
<p>
      If you are building GtkGLExt from the distributed source packages,
      then won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as 
      <tt class="literal">tar.gz</tt> or <tt class="literal">tar.bz2</tt> file
      which you unpack into a directory full of the source files as follows:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      tar zxvf gtkglext-x.y.z.tar.gz

      tar jxvf gtkglext-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    </pre>
<p>
      In the toplevel of the directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <tt class="filename">configure</tt> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <tt class="filename">Makefile.in</tt> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system. The <tt class="filename">configure</tt>
      script can be passed various command line arguments to determine how
      the package is built and installed. The most commonly useful
      argument is the <tt class="systemitem">--prefix</tt> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <tt class="filename">/opt/gtk</tt> you would run configure as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk
    </pre>
<p>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <tt class="filename">configure</tt> with the
      <tt class="systemitem">--help</tt> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <tt class="filename">configure</tt>, you then run the
      <span><b class="command">make</b></span> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      make
      make install
    </pre>
<p>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <tt class="literal">make install</tt>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <span><b class="command">ldconfig</b></span> after
      <tt class="literal">make install</tt> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </p>
<p>
      If you want to compile example programs shipped with the source
      package, run the following command.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      make examples
    </pre>
<p>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <tt class="envar">CPPFLAGS</tt> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <tt class="envar">LDFLAGS</tt> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <tt class="envar">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</tt> environment variable contains
      a search path that <span><b class="command">pkg-config</b></span> (see below)
      uses when looking for for file describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GTK+
      and it's dependencies into <tt class="filename">/opt/gtk</tt>,
      you might want to set these variables as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/gtk/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gtk/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </pre>
<p>
      You may also need to set the <tt class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <tt class="envar">PATH</tt>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/gtk/lib"
      PATH="/opt/gtk/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </pre>

<p>
      Before you can compile the GtkGLExt library, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating GTK+
      mentioned above such as <span class="application">autoconf</span>)
      are <span><b class="command">pkg-config</b></span> and GNU make.
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>
	  <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/" target="_top">pkg-config</a>
	  is a tool for tracking the compilation flags needed for
	  libraries that is used by the GTK+ libraries. (For each
	  library, a small <tt class="literal">.pc</tt> text file is
	  installed in a standard location that contains the
	  compilation flags needed for that library along with version
	  number information.)
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  The GtkGLExt makefiles will mostly work with different versions
	  of <span><b class="command">make</b></span>, however, there tends to be
	  a few incompatibilities, so we recommend installing
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make" target="_top">GNU make</a>
          if you don't already have it on your system
	  and using it. (It may be called <span><b class="command">gmake</b></span>
	  rather than <span><b class="command">make</b></span>.)

<a name="extra-configuration-options"></a><h2>Extra Configuration Options</h2>
<p>
        In addition to the normal options, the
	<span><b class="command">configure</b></span> script for the GtkGLExt
	supports the following additional arguments.

	</p>
<div class="cmdsynopsis"><p><tt class="command">configure</tt>  [[--with-gl-prefix=DIR]] [[--with-gl-includedir=DIR]] [[--with-gl-libdir=DIR]] [[--enable-debug=[no|minimum|yes]]] [[--disable-gtk-doc] |  [--enable-gtk-doc]] [[--with-html-dir=PATH]] [[--with-gdktarget=[x11|win32]]]</p></div>
<p>
      </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--with-gl-prefix=DIR</tt>.&#160;</b>
	  Directory where OpenGL (Mesa) is installed.
	  The default is 'auto'.
        </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--with-gl-includedir=DIR</tt>.&#160;</b>
	  Directory where OpenGL (Mesa) header files are installed.
	  The default is 'auto'.
        </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--with-gl-libdir=DIR</tt>.&#160;</b>
	  Directory where OpenGL (Mesa) libraries are installed.
	  The default is 'auto'.
        </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--enable-debug</tt>.&#160;</b>
         Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to 'no' 
	 disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail() and
         all cast checks between different object types. Setting it to 'minimum'
         disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables 
         <a href="gtkglext-running.html#GTK-GL-Debug-Options">runtime debugging</a>. 
         The default is 'minimum'.
         Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize 
         even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs 
         from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus 
         <tt class="option">--enable-debug=no</tt> should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> 
         be used for stable releases of GtkGLExt.
        </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--disable-gtk-doc</tt> and
	  <tt class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</tt>.&#160;</b>
	  The <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> package is
	  used to generate the reference documentation included
	  with GtkGLExt. By default support for
	  <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> 
	  is disabled because it requires various extra dependencies
	  to be installed. If you have
	  <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> installed and
	  are modifying GtkGLExt, you may want to enable
	  <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> support by passing
	  in <tt class="systemitem">--enable-gtk-doc</tt>. If not
	  enabled, pre-generated HTML files distributed with GtkGLExt
	  will be installed.
	</p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--with-html-dir</tt>.&#160;</b>
         Path to installed the reference documentation. The default is
         <tt class="filename">${datadir}/gtk-doc/html</tt>.
        </p>
<p><b><tt class="systemitem">--with-gdktarget</tt>.&#160;</b>
          Toggles between the supported backends for GdkGLExt. 
          The default is x11, unless the platform is Windows, in which
	  case the default is win32.
